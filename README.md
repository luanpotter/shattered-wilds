# shattered-wilds

Shattered Wilds is a work-in-progress base setting for a new TTRPG system based on D12 dice rolls.

## Setting

In Shattered Wilds, the world is ever-shifting. Not fast enough that you could see - but within a few months, routes between settlements could be lost; rivers could change course, mountains could start to emerge or dwindle back into the ground; forests could wander, and trails could lead to new places and ruins that hadn't been seen for decades. The only constants are settlements, villages, towns, cities or any sufficient congregation of people - those are stable and do not move. But the routes between them are always changing, compasses are useless (always spinning seemingly at random), and maps become outdated quickly after they are drawn.

Travel, therefore, is a risky proposition. The Wilds, when uncharted, are perilous, presenting harsh conditions for the unprepared, and filled with dangerous creatures - both beasts and people - and of course the Hollow. Adventurers double as cartographers, and venture forth into the wild to establish new temporary routes, to allow for bursts of commerce and passage for the common folk, at least for a brief period of time. Some strong enough to withstand the Wilds choose to live by themselves; others form parties to explore and learn more about the world.

On smaller settlements, such as the villages the players are from, or the one they shall gather on, knowledge is not lacking but limited. People know of stories of the world and the past, but many have never left their birthplaces. Well-known in all villages is the elusive city known as the The Citadel, a huge and prospers settlement where members of all races live in harmony, and where magic and technology flourish. It is possible to find some that have been there, and while they are rare in each village, the knowledge of its existence is not disputed. Getting there, however, as with any traveling, is a different matter entirely.

Smaller villages often house a majority of one or two races, but the others are common enough occurrences to be known. As even the smallest village can be a pivotal point in the paths of many travelers and adventurers, the commoners are not stranger to seeing adventurers, other people, heroes or magic, though very powerful champions are exceedingly rare.

### The Aether

The Aether can be thought of as a mix between the spiritual realm and the astral plane of Shattered Wilds. Every living creature has a spark in the Aether, that is attached to their physical body. Sentient sparks attached to physical bodies are called Souls. The gods (called Proteans) are essentially pure souls, that have fully unbound from the material plane and therefore have complete reign on the Aether. While they have no physical body, they can manifest as a physical avatar, but unlike a creature body and spark that are bound together, the Protean can simply abandon any avatar at will. Divine magic involves channeling forces through the Aether, and while it does not have unlimited range, it has a much greater reach than Arcane magic, which is but the truer understanding and manipulation of the physical world.

### The Hollow

A Hollow is a hulking, bestial predator that stalks the shifting Wilds. Their bodies completely covered in thick, bristling spines and spikes that stand on end like an unnatural mane, and their head broad and low, featuring a singular hollow cavity where an eye might once have been, radiating an eerie sense of hunger from the complete darkness within. They have two powerful front limbs, doubling as either arms for striking or front legs for bearing weight, each ending in three thick, clawed fingers - a larger central one surrounded by two smaller ones; forming a grip strong enough to crush or to crudely wield scavenged weapons. Their stance is that of a primal, four-limbed hunter, moving with a loping gait when on all fours; the hind legs are thick and muscular, bent for sudden bursts of speed. A long, whip-like tail trails behind it, balancing its large frame as it moves.

The Hollow seem to emerge from cracks and rifts leftover of recent shifts in the Wilds. Creatures of darkness, they are physical manifestations of voids on the Aether, the opposite of a spark - which is why they feed on unsuspecting creatures and consume their essence when they fall prey - though they would much rather seek the much larger Soul of a sentient being.

### Known Tropes

Some known tropes from other high-fantasy TTRPG settings that are not present or are different in Shattered Wilds:

 * there is no teleportation of matter or energy
 * action-at-a-distance is limited to the Aether, and even then it is not infinite
 * gods (the Protean) are not all-powerful and definitely not omni-present, though they can be very powerful
 * there is no known way to resurrect the dead, once a mortal spark is severed from its body, while it can linger in the Aether for a few minutes, it will eventually fade away

## System

Shattered Wilds use a custom system called The D12 System, in which checks are based on a 2d12 roll.

### Attributes

The Attributes in the D12 System are a ternary tree featuring a trickle down mechanism, and starting with your Level as the root attribute. Your Level then divides into 3 realms: Body, Mind and Soul, and they combined branch to the 9 Basic Attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA, DIV, FOW, LCK). Finally, the Basic Attributes branch into 27 Skills.

| Root  |   Realm    | Basic Attribute | Skill       | Description                                                                                                                            |

The way the trickle down works is, for every point you earn on a node past the first, you get to propagate that point to one of the three children. So at Level 1, every single adventurer has the same attributes (bar racial and class bonuses of course). But when they level up to 2, they get to propagate to the Body/Mind/Soul tier, and thus make their first attribute choice. On Level 3, you can propagate to the same node as before, doubling down on one of the 3 realms, and getting to propagate again, or you can generalize and pick a second realm to focus on.

The way modifiers work is that you always roll the most specific check you can, normally a Skill check for skills or a Basic Attribute for core game actions (such as attacks); your modifier on each node is based on its value and the values of the parents:

* Your Level modifier is just the Level node value
* Your Realm modifier is the Realm node + the Level node / 4 (rounded up)
* Your Basic Attribute modifier is the Basic Attribute node + the Realm node / 2 (rounded up) + the Level node / 4 (rounded up)
* Your Skill modifier is 2 * the skill node + the Basic Attribute modifier

Note that will shall very rarely need to use modifiers for nodes other than Basic Attributes and Skills.

### Derived Stats

You have 4 pools of points that are derived from your attributes:

* Heroism Points are based on your Level; each character has a max number of Heroism Points equal to their Level value. They can be used to invoke Extras and Luck (see below), to call for Write History. These are harder to recover, at one per long rest rate plus the DM can award Heroism Points (within your maximum) to reward good roleplaying or other out-of-the-box thinking (similar to the Inspiration mechanic in D&D 5e).
* Vitality Points are based on your Body and represent your physical ability to keep going during intense situations. They are analogous to Health on other games, but in the D12 System, you only take real damage after you are exhausted. You have a max Vitality Points equal to 4 + your Body modifier. You lose Vitality when you are attacked, and they can also spend it to power special abilities.
* Focus Points are based on your Mind and represent your mental vigor and ability to focus during intense situations. They are analogous to Mana in other games for Arcane casters, but they are also used by any characters to power special abilities that require focus, mental acuity and concentration. You have a max Focus Points equal to 4 + your Mind modifier. You can lose Focus Points when you are distracted.
* Spirit Points are based on your Soul and represent your morale and spiritual strength. They are a different form of Mana (for non-Arcane powers) or a form of mental stress or morale in other games, but they are also used by any characters to power special abilities. You have a max Spirit Points equal to 4 + your Soul modifier.

Other derived stats are:

* Initiative = Awareness + Agility, used to determine order in combat via an Initiative Check
* Speed = BASE + Agility + Stamina, used to determine how far you can move in a turn

### Checks

A base Check is `2d12 + [Modifiers]`, and is either matched against a DC (Difficulty Class) of the task (Static Check, which is always considered Active), or matched against a check from an opponent (Contested Check). On Contested Checks, there is always an active participant, which is the one taking the Action (Active Contested Check), and one or more passive recipients of the action (Passive Contested Checks).

Success means having a result greater than the DC (or Passive Contested Check), meaning that a tie normally means maintain the status quo (no change). However, if the Active Participant has a Crit Modifier (see below), they will win ties.

There is also the possibility of rolling extra D12s, up to two, for two different mechanics, Extras and Luck (see below). Whenever you roll more than 2 dice, you get to pick which 2 to use, as you can never sum up more than 2 dies (think D&D Advantage). So if you are using Extra and Luck in the same roll, you will be able to roll 4d12, and pick any 2 of your choice.  Note that, unlike other systems, extra dice rolls are not awarded for in-game situational "advantages" or "disadvantages", as these factors are _always_ modelled as Modifiers to the roll (player modifiers or circumstantial modifiers).

#### Crit Modifiers

Critical Rolls are handled differently in the D12 system. There are two steps to determine criticality; first, you apply Crit Modifiers to your roll:

 * +6 to your roll if you have at least one 12
 * +6 to your roll if you have at least a pair

Note that you can get each one of the +6's only once per roll, for a max total of +12. That means the maximum natural roll is 36 (2 * 12 + 6 + 6), with a probability of 1/144 (0.69%).

Crit Modifiers are applied to all types of Checks. However, if you are rolling an Active Check (typically an Active Contested Check), you can also accumulate Crit Shifts.

#### Crit Shifts

If the active participant passes the check, finally they can convert any excesses of +6 into a Crit Shift, even if they didn't originate from a Crit Modifier.

These Crit Shifts are typically only applicable for Active Contested Checks, however they could also be used for some Static Checks, depending on the situation.

So for a few examples, you attack the enemy and roll a 10 and 7, and have a total modifier of +3. That will be a 20 without any Crit Modifier; however if the opponent contests rolling a total of 12, since you an advantage of 8 points, you get 1 Crit Shift.

What does this "Shift" mean? The effect of a Crit Shift will depend on the nature of the check. If it is a Basic Attack, that means additional damage to the enemy's Vitality Points. If it is some other form of contest, it means an advantage to be determined by the DM. For example, if you are trying to influence an ally to do you a favor, they might not just do it but somehow consider it as you doing them a favor for the honor of asking them. This is similar to how Shifts work on Core FATE. If it is a Static Check, typically Crit Shifts are not applicable, but could depending on the specific situation.

So in essence, the Crit Modifiers are two-folded; if you would otherwise be below target, they help you get over, and if you are already over, they can give you extra Shifts.

#### Auto Fail

There is also an Auto Fail condition to any Active Checks; if you roll a pair of 1s, you instantly fail the check, regardless of anything else. This condition is checked across all the dies you roll, even ones you did not pick or even ones that were not valid (for Extra and Luck dice).

The probability of an Auto Fail, if rolling two dice, is of 0.69% (though that is bumped to 3.72% if rolling 4 dice).

#### Extra

It is possible to roll an extra d12 when doing a check by invoking an Extra. You can do that when you are in a situation in which you can leverage a different base attribute to perform a Skill check. For example, imagine you are trying to deceive a guard with a Speechcraft check, but you have a high WIS. You can leverage your WIS score to complement your Speechcraft modifier by invoking an Extra. Extra (and Luck) Dice must be invoked before the roll is made, and you must pay 1 Heroism Point to do so. You roll an extra distinct d12, and you must roll less or equal than your Extra modifier. If you do, that is a valid Extra die that can be picked for the final total. If you roll more than your attribute, you just ignore that die for the final total. Note that regardless if you pick the extra die or even if it is valid or not, for active contested rolls, if you roll a pair of 1s amongst any of your dies, that is an Auto Fail.

#### Luck

Similarly (and potentially additionally) to Extra, you can invoke your supernatural Luck to aid you in any roll. You similarly must pay 1 Heroism Point, and add one distinct Luck d12 to the pool. The result of it must be below your Fortune score. Same rules as for the Extra die apply, including the extended chance of Auto Fail. Pushing your luck goes both ways.

**Conditions** are temporary effects that can be applied to characters during [[Encounter | Encounters]] and other situations. They represent various states of impairment or advantage that affect a character's capabilities.

Conditions can be caused by various sources such as [[Action | Actions]], spells, environmental hazards, or other game effects. Some conditions last until the end of the affected character's next turn, while others can be cleared with a [[Action]].

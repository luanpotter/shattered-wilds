**Conditions** are temporary effects that can be applied to characters during [[Encounter | Encounters]] and other situations. They represent various states of impairment or advantage that affect a character's capabilities.

Conditions can be caused by various sources such as [[Action | Actions]], spells, environmental hazards, or other game effects. Typically, they persist until cleared (usually through an [[Action]]), though some conditions have ranks that tick down per round. Bar any special circumstances, conditions can be considered cleared when the encounter ends.

The [Arcane](/rules/arcane) is a hard science, nothing but the truer understanding and manipulation of the physical world. Through either study, intuition, or natural talent, Arcanists produce precise shockwaves true several means to affect reality in specific and predictable ways. It is a hard magical system, where the Player decides _what_ they want to achieve, and the GM tells them the _Spell DC_.

In contrast, the [Divine](/rules/divine) is a much soft magic system, where the Player rolls a check, and the GM decides what the spell will do. **Adepts** have a strong connection to the **Aether**, and can draw and channel power from higher forces or beings.

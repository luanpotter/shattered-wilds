A Hollow is a hulking, bestial predator that stalks the Shifting Wilds. Their bodies completely covered in thick, bristling spines and spikes that stand on end like an unnatural mane, and their head broad and low, featuring a singular hollow cavity where an eye might once have been, radiating an eerie sense of hunger from the complete darkness within. They have two powerful front limbs, doubling as either arms for striking or front legs for bearing weight, each ending in three thick, clawed fingers - a larger central one surrounded by two smaller ones; forming a grip strong enough to crush or to crudely wield scavenged weapons. Their stance is that of a primal, four-limbed hunter, moving with a loping gait when on all fours; the hind legs are thick and muscular, bent for sudden bursts of speed. A long, whip-like tail trails behind it, balancing its large frame as it moves.

The Hollow seem to emerge from cracks and rifts leftover of recent shifts in the Wilds. Creatures of darkness, they are physical manifestations of voids on the Aether, the opposite of a spark - which is why they feed on unsuspecting creatures and consume their essence when they fall prey - though they would much rather seek the much larger Soul of a sentient being.

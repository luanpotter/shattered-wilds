The **Aether** can be thought of as a mix between the _spiritual realm_ and the _astral plane_ of **Shattered Wilds**. Every living creature has a _Spark_ in the **Aether**, that is attached to their physical body. Sentient _Sparks_ attached to physical bodies are called _Souls_. The gods (called **Proteans**) are essentially pure souls, that have fully unbound from the material plane and therefore have complete reign on the **Aether**. While they have no physical body, they can manifest as a physical _avatar_, but unlike a creature body and _Spark_ that are bound together, the Protean can simply abandon any avatar at will. Divine magic involves channeling forces through the **Aether**, either of **Proteans** or your own.

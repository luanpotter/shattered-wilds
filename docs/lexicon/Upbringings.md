Your upbringing grants you three **Core Feats**:

* **Upbringing Modifiers**: A pair of [[Mind]]/[[Soul]] Realms modifiers (`+1` in one Attribute, `-1` in another), which will also bypass level cap.
* The [[Level]] 0 **Core Feat** from your chosen **Upbringing**
* The **[[Specialized_Knowledge | Specialized Knowledge]]** feat associated with your **Upbringing** (You have `+3` to [[Knowledge]] or [[Intuition]] Checks about aspects related to your upbringing environment).

Players are welcome to craft their own **Upbringings** with their DMs, but there are five pre-defined options to choose from. You can still choose any attributes for the modifiers, but you should choose a pair of modifiers that make sense with your backstory. If your class is a **Caster** or **Mystic**, choosing your the `+1` modifier to go to your **Primary Attribute** is usually inherently justifiable.

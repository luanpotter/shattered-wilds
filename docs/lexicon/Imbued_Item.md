An item that holds a direct connection to the **Aether**, be it with a higher power or force, granting it wondrous properties.

Simpler **Imbued Items** typically are simple to operate, requiring just 1 [[Action_Points | Action Point]] and 1 [[Spirit_Points | Spirit Point]] to activate. However, more complex items or even larger objects or structures might require a [[Attunement]] Check to activate.

Imbued Items can include wondrous **Wands**, **Staves** and other **Focal Components** that can assist with [Arcane Spellcasting](/rules/arcane); essentially using their Divine power as a means to assist the casting of **Arcane** spells.

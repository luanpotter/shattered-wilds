Can be performed at the end of the day by resting for about 8 hours. During this downtime period, characters can:

* Recover their [[Resource | Resource Points]] (except for [[Heroism_Point | Heroism Points]], of which you regain 1).
* Clear up to `3` _ranks_ of [[Exhaustion]].
* Advance one of their personal projects.

They can only take a **Long Rest** again after around one day has passed, so in the meanwhile they can partially recover with a [[Short Rest]] (in exchange for a _rank_ of [[Exhaustion]]).

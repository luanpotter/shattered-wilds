Actions are the fundamental building blocks of combat and interaction in **Shattered Wilds**.

Each character has a limited number of [[Resource_Action_Point | Action Points]] (AP) per turn that they can spend to perform actions (including reactions).

## Type: Movement

These are actions associated with movement, and can take several forms. All movement forms can move at least 1 hex, regardless of the character's Speed. Unused movement cannot be saved for later.

## Type: Attack

These are actions in which the intent is to inflict damage (either to [[Resource_Vitality_Point | VP]], [[Resource_Focus_Point | FP]] or [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]]) to an opponent. Attack Actions are an active contested check against the target's Defense (which depends on the nature of the Attack).

Attack Actions can be either **Basic** or **Special**. Basic Attack actions are always an Attribute Check (STR or DEX for Physical attacks or the Spellcasting Attribute for Spell Attacks) contested by the target's Realm as Defense (for example, a STR check against a target's Body). Basic Attacks typically cause one damage when they succeed, and Shifts cause extra damage points.

**Special Attacks** are contested against specific [[Skills]], depending on the nature of the attack. Special Attacks might cause other effects, such as [[Condition | Conditions]], and also cause damage.

## Type: Reaction

These are actions that can be taken at any time in combat, often in response to a specific event or situation. Unlike other systems, a character can take as many Reactions as they want, as long as they have the [[Resource_Action_Point | AP]] to afford them.

Since your **AP** is replenished at the end of your turn, you do not need to decide whether to "save" **AP** for reactions.

## Type: Miscellaneous

These are actions that do not fit into the other categories.

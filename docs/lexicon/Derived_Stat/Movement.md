The amount of hexes a character can move using a regular [[Action_Stride | Stride]] action.

> Movement = [3 (humanoid base) + Size Modifier + ([[Stat_Agility | Agility]] / 4) (rounded down)] hexes

This determines how many hexes a character can move in a single turn. The formula includes:

- **3 hexes** as the base movement for humanoid creatures
- **Size Modifier** based on the character's size category
- **Agility bonus** calculated as Agility divided by 4, rounded down

All movement forms can move at least 1 hex, regardless of the character's calculated movement speed. Unused movement cannot be saved for later.

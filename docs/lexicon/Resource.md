**Resource Points** are any type of points that characters can expend in order to pay for certain costs. A character will have a maximum amount of each type of Resource Point, that can never be exceeded. Different types of resources are recovered in different ways. Some resources are considered crucial, meaning that if they are fully depleted, the character is considered [[Condition_Incapacitated | Incapacitated]].

The most **ephemeral** resource point is the [[Resource_Action_Point | Action Point]] That represents the amount of actions you can perform every turn in an [[Encounter]], and is replenished at the end of your turn.

Then we have the three **crucial** Resource Points, each representing one of the character's [[Realm | Realms]], that can be recovered with a [[Short Rest]]:

* [[Resource_Vitality_Point | Vitality Points]] ([[Body]])
* [[Resource_Focus_Point | Focus Points]] ([[Mind]])
* [[Resource_Spirit_Point | Spirit Points]] ([[Soul]])

Reaching zero of any of these points will cause the character to be [[Condition_Incapacitated | Incapacitated]].

Finally, there are the [[Resource_Heroism_Point | Heroism Points]]; they are recovered as the DM awards them to Players for their actions.

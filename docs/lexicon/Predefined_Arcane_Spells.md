While a **Caster** can choose any effect within the domains of the **Arcane**, below is a list of predefined spells with predefined Augmentation Modifiers making it easier for Players and DMs; they can both be used exactly as-is, or used to judge modifiers by comparison.

Across all **Schools**, the **Fundamental Arcane Spell** takes **2 [[Action_Points | AP]]** and **1 [[Focus_Points | FP]]** to cast, with **Base DC 15** (or contested if higher), and range based on your [[Influence Range]].

Some typical Augmentations for each are combined to form the **Minimal Augmentation Modifier**; do note that every single spell can be Augmented by **Range**, which is the most common Augmentation; so that will not be included.

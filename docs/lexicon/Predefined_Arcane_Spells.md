While a **Caster** can choose any effect within the domains of the **Arcane**, below is a list of predefined spells with predefined Augmentation Modifiers making it easier for Players and DMs; they can both be used exactly as-is, or used to judge modifiers by comparison.

Across all **Schools**, the **Fundamental Arcane Spell** takes **2 [[Action_Point | AP]]** and **1 [[Focus_Point | FP]]** to cast, with **Base DC 15** (or contested if higher), and range based on your [[Influence Range]].

Some typical Augmentations for each are combined to form the **Minimal Augmentation Modifier**; do note that every single spell can be Augmented by **Range**, which is the most common Augmentation; so that will not be included.

### Conjuration

The **Conjuration** Fundamental Arcane Spell can be used to create between 1-10L of simple, homogeneous, inorganic matter of a simple material (dirt, gravel, sand, weak rocks), in a space unoccupied (by solid matter or Beings), arranged in a vaguely, imprecise, contiguous, convex spherical blob (or to fill an existing hole). Any fluid matter in the location will be displaced (therefore matter cannot be created in hermetically sealed containers).

The **Caster** must be familiar with the material being conjured; we can assume all **Heroes** are familiar with simple materials, water or other common matter. However, certain spells below will require the **Caster** to have been familiar with the specific matter being created.

### Evocation

The Evocation Fundamental Arcane Spell can be used to create a small amount of energy of a simple type (light, fire), in a space unoccupied (by solid matter or Beings; though it can be adjacent to inanimate objects, for example, it can set fire to a torch), within 1m of the Caster. The energy will dissipate over time (depending on the type of energy), and will spread/behave in its natural way (e.g. fire will spread to adjacent flammable objects, light will illuminate the area, etc.), but not otherwise move.

### Transmutation

The Transmutation Fundamental Arcane Spell can be used to change the state of a small amount of matter, between 1-10L, within 1m of the Caster. The matter can be changed from one simple material to another (e.g. dirt to sand, gravel to pebbles), or be modified in its change or properties. Changing the physical state (solid, liquid, gas) is a more complex proposition. Other augmentations can be at play if trying to change specific parts, detailed aspects, or complex materials.

### Telekinesis

The Telekinesis Fundamental Arcane Spell can be used to impart motion up to 2kg of matter consistently but at moderate speeds, within the selected range (the object can be thrown outside the range but control is lost at that point). Telekinesis can be used to manipulate objects, such as doors or levers, but the required level of dexterity will add some Augmentation. While Beings cannot be directly imparted energy, the Caster can control the air around them to push or shove, in a however less effective and precise manner.

### Transfiguration

The Transfiguration Fundamental Arcane Spell can be used to change the body of a Being, within 1m of the Caster. The basic spell can cause superficial changes (e.g. changing hair color, creating calluses, deformities, or other minor changes), and anything more complex changes will require Augmentations. The changes are always temporary, and require Concentration to maintain. The target can choose wether to resist or not as they feel an external force molding their body.

### Command

The Command Fundamental Arcane Spell can be used to mentally tax a sentient Being's willpower, causing them to lose 1SP unless resist; or try to control simple beasts and plants. More Augmented casts can try to issue specific commands, and forcing them to do something fundamentally against their nature will require a very high DC.

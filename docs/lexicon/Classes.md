There are a total of `30` classes available in **Shattered Wilds**, but this large number is just a result of the combinatorics of a few different roles and flavors, so it is easier to break it down by categorization than providing a complete list upfront.

Characters will pick a **Class** at Level 1 (the first level for a **Hero**). At that level, they will receive their **Class Modifier** (Core Feat), which is a `+1` bonus to their **Primary Attribute**; and two **Core Class Feats**, normally related to their **Role** and **Flavor**. Characters can also pick any **Major** or **Minor Feats** from their **Class Feats** list to fill any slots as they level up.

The first major decision in picking your **Class** is whether you will be a **Warrior**, a **Caster**, or a **Mystic**. These basically map to the primary **Realm** that is embodied by the character ([[Body]], [[Mind]], and [[Soul]], respectively).

**Warriors** are the equivalent of the "martials" in D&D, and their primary attribute will be either [[STR]], [[DEX]] or [[CON]]. They are experts in physical attacks with weapons, and their unique **Feats** focus on powerful maneuvers and tactics in combat.

**Casters** are the equivalent of the arcane spellcasters in D&D, and they heavily used their [[Mind]] to learn the details of the [Arcane](/rules/arcane). They can still (and should) use weapons, as all characters are expected to be fighters, but their unique **Feats** involve leveraging their **Arcane** knowledge to cast spells and manipulate the world around them. In **Shattered Wilds**, the **Arcane** is a magic and a science, and its effects are down-to-earth and predictable, yet they can be very powerful. However, casting spells requires a strong [[Mind]] and costs [[Focus_Point | Focus Points]]. Different classes will differ around how flexible / versatile or specific their **Feats** are, and what is the nature of their powers (which determines their primary attribute between [[INT]], [[WIS]], and [[CHA]]).

Finally, **Mystics** are the equivalent of the divine spellcasters in D&D, and they have used their [[Soul]] to connect to the **Aether** and the powerful gods that inhabit it (the **Protean**). They have a much more chaotic and less predictable form of magic, of which they are only vessels **channeling** forces beyond their control and understanding. A rule of thumb would be that a **Caster** chooses the result of their spell, and then roll to assert success, while a **Mystic** will roll and have the DM determine the outcome. They have more specific spells (but still flexible) with less predictable effects, and can do certain types of magic such as healing, buffs or divination that are outside the bounds of the **Arcane**. Their **Primary Attribute** will be [[DIV]], [[FOW]] or [[LCK]], depending on what kind of power they are channeling.

## Warriors

There are 9 Warrior classes, which are divided in a `3x3` matrix of **Roles** and **Flavors**. Each **Role** will define a **Core Major Feat** while each **Flavor** will define a **Core Minor Feat**. On top of that, they will each define their own track of future **Feats** to be picked from. Starting at Level 2, a character's **Class Feats** list will include all options from both their **Role** or **Flavor** tracks.

| Role / Flavor | Martial     | Survivalist     | Scoundrel        |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Melee (STR)   | [[Fighter]] | [[Berserker]]   | [[Swashbuckler]] |
| Ranged (DEX)  | [[Marksman]]| [[Hunter]]      | [[Rogue]]        |
| Tank (CON)    | [[Guardian]]| [[Barbarian]]   | [[Scout]]        |

The **Role** will also define your **Primary Attribute** ([[STR]], [[DEX]] or [[CON]]) for the **Core Class Modifier**.

## Casters

There are a total of 12 **Caster** classes, which are divided in a 3x4 matrix depending on their **Role** (**Primary Attribute** and source of their powers) and **Flavor** (manifestation of that power).

| Role / Flavor  | Arcanist     | Mechanist     | Naturalist     | Musicist        |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Erudite (INT)  | [[Wizard]]   | [[Engineer]]  | [[Alchemist]]  | [[Storyteller]] |
| Intuitive (WIS)| [[Mage]]     | [[Artificer]] | [[Druid]]      | [[Minstrel]]    |
| Innate (CHA)   | [[Sorcerer]] | [[Machinist]] | [[Shaman]]     | [[Bard]]        |

The **Core Major Feat** for all **Casters** is:

## Mystics

Unlike the **Arcane**, the **Divine** is a much softer magical system, by which **Mystics** use their connection to the **Aether** to outsource the power of external entities (Proteans), their own Soul, or Luck itself. It is definitely _not_ a science, and it is _not_ predictable. Instead of describing exact desired effects as the **Casters** do, **Mystics** have vague desires and roll a Check, letting the DM decide the effect.

There are a total of 9 **Mystic** classes, which are divided in a 3x3 matrix depending on their **Role** (which determines their **Primary Attribute**) and **Flavor** (wether they purely dedicate to their channeling or have some mixed martial characteristics).

| Role / Flavor | Devout       | Mixed         | Crusader    |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Disciple (DIV)| [[Cleric]]   | [[Warlock]]   | [[Paladin]] |
| Adept (FOW)   | [[Sage]]     | [[Monk]]      | [[Ranger]]  |
| Inspired (LCK)| [[Wanderer]] | [[Wayfarer]]  | [[Warden]]  |

The realm of the **Divine** can produce effects much different than that of the **Arcane**, such as:

* Direct Healing and Harming
* Buffs and Debuffs
* Divination
* Illusions (including Invisibility)
* Luck Manipulation (through [[LCK]])

However, differently from the **Casters** table, this matrix is a bit more diverse; each **Role** will have access to different tools and abilities (though some form of **Channeling** will always connect all **Mystics**):

* **The Disciple**: Employ their [[DIV]] to submit to a specific **Protean** and channel their power.
* **The Adept**: Leverage their [[FOW]] and self-control to connect to the **Aether** and channel the true power of their own Soul.
* **The Inspired**: Receive their [[LCK]] through a literally unexplainable connection to beyond the **Aether**.

Therefore, much like it is for the **Warriors**, your **Role** will define your **Core Major Feat**, while your **Flavor** will define your **Core Minor Feat**.

## The Disciple

{% text "Disciple_Mystic" %}

Regardless of the nature of their connection, the **Disciple** can:

* Actively **Channel** powers from the **Aether** into the material world (i.e. [[Divine Channeling]]), using a [[DIV]] Check;
* Actively **Pray** as a one-way communication with their **Protean** to inform their desires, needs, concerns and requests, typically done once a day after a [[Long Rest]], using a [[Devotion]] Check;
* Passively receive messages, guidance, or visions from their **Protean**, at the discretion of the DM.

In exchange, they are responsible for respecting and furthering their **Protean**'s cause. Unlike other settings, there is no defined pantheon of impossibly powerful (or even omnipotent) gods. Instead, players should work with their DMs to create **Proteans** as part of their character creation. However, some pre-defined templates will be provided below.

Typically, **Disciples** will **Pray** once at the start of every day (after a [[Long Rest]]), and they can at this moment express their vague desires, needs, and concerns to their **Protean**. They can attempt to ask for more specific requests, but depending on the type of request, how aligned it is with their **Protean**'s cause, the complexity, specificity and difficulty of the requests, it will be less likely to succeed. Regardless of the ask, the character will do a [[Devotion]] Check, and the DM will rule over the outcome, which might be nothing right now, undisclosed things that might happen later, or might include any immediate messages, visions, omens, guidance or requests from the **Protean**.

A character can attempt to **Pray** on any longer moments of peace and quiet (like a [[Short Rest]]), but typically praying more than once a day is infective. Similarly, a DM might request a [[Devotion]] Check at any moment, depending on circumstances, the nature of the **Protean** and the connection, or any other reason.

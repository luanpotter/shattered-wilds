There are a total of `30` classes available in **Shattered Wilds**, but this large number is just a result of the combinatorics of a few different roles and flavors, so it is easier to break it down by categorization than providing a complete list upfront.

Characters will pick a **Class** at Level 1 (the first level for a **Hero**). At that level, they will receive their **Core Class Modifier**, which is a `+1` bonus to their **Primary Attribute**; and their **Core Class Major & Minor Feats**.

Then, starting at Level 2, each class provides a set of **Class Feats** that become available on each level. When you level up, you can pick any one **Major** and one **Minor Feat** from your **Class Feats** or the **Generic Feats** lists (the latter available to all classes), from your level or any previous level. There is no multi-classing rules, as the classes already represented broken-down combinations of different archetypes.

The first major decision in picking your **Class** is whether you will be a **Warrior**, a **Caster**, or a **Mystic**. These basically map to the primary Realm that is embodied by the character ([[Stat_Body | Body]], [[Stat_Mind | Mind]], and [[Stat_Soul | Soul]], respectively).

**Warriors** are the equivalent of the "martials" in D&D, and their primary attribute will be either [[Stat_STR | STR]], [[Stat_DEX | DEX]] or [[Stat_CON | CON]]. They are experts in physical attacks with weapons, and their unique **Feats** focus on powerful maneuvers and tactics in combat.

**Casters** are the equivalent of the arcane spellcasters in D&D, and they heavily used their [[Stat_Mind | Mind]] to learn the details of the [Arcane](/rules/arcane). They can still (and should) use weapons, as all characters are expected to be fighters, but their unique **Feats** involve leveraging their **Arcane** knowledge to cast spells and manipulate the world around them. In **Shattered Wilds**, the **Arcane** is a magic and a science, and its effects are down-to-earth and predictable, yet they can be very powerful. However, casting spells requires a strong [[Stat_Mind | Mind]] and costs [[Resource_Focus_Point | Focus Points]]. Different classes will differ around how flexible / versatile or specific their **Feats** are, and what is the nature of their powers (which determines their primary attribute between [[Stat_INT | INT]], [[Stat_WIS | WIS]], and [[Stat_CHA | CHA]]).

Finally, **Mystics** are the equivalent of the divine spellcasters in D&D, and they have used their [[Stat_Soul | Soul]] to connect to the **Aether** and the powerful gods that inhabit it (the **Protean**). They have a much more chaotic and less predictable form of magic, of which they are only vessels **channeling** forces beyond their control and understanding. A rule of thumb would be that a **Caster** chooses the result of their spell, and then roll to assert success, while a **Mystic** will roll and have the DM determine the outcome. They have more specific spells (but still flexible) with less predictable effects, and can do certain types of magic such as healing, buffs or divination that are outside the bounds of the **Arcane**. Their **Primary Attribute** will be [[Stat_DIV | DIV]], [[Stat_FOW | FOW]] or [[Stat_LCK | LCK]], depending on what kind of power they are channeling.

## Warriors

There are 9 Warrior classes, which are divided in a `3x3` matrix of **Roles** and **Flavors**. Each **Role** will define a **Core Major Feat** while each **Flavor** will define a **Core Minor Feat**. On top of that, they will each define their own track of future **Feats** to be picked from. Starting at Level 2, a character's **Class Feats** list will include all options from both their **Role** or **Flavor** tracks.

| Role / Flavor | Martial | Survivalist | Scoundrel    |
|---------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Melee (STR)   | Fighter | Berserker   | Swashbuckler |
| Ranged (DEX)  | Marksman| Hunter      | Rogue        |
| Tank (CON)    | Guardian| Barbarian   | Scout        |

The **Role** will also define your **Primary Attribute** (STR, DEX or CON) for the **Core Class Modifier**.

### Melee Warriors Feats

Melee Warriors focus on Strength, and thus are favored to use **Heavy Melee** or **Thrown** weapons (see a Weapons breakdown under [Equipment](rules/equipment)).

* **Sweep Attack** (Core Major Feat, Level 1): You can spend 3 [[Resource_Action_Point | AP]] and 1 [[Resource_Focus_Point | FP]] to perform an advanced **Melee Strike** against up to three adjacent enemies within your reach. You roll once for all targets, but they Resist separately.
* **Spin Attack** (Major Feat, Level 2): {% TODO %}

### Ranged Warriors Feats

Ranged Warriors focus on Dexterity, and thus are favored to use **Light Melee** or **Ranged** weapons (or both).

* **Take Aim** (Core Major Feat, Level 1): Spend 1 [[Resource_Focus_Point | FP]] and 1 [[Resource_Action_Point | AP]] to target a specific enemy within range of your Ranged Weapon and that you can see clearly; if your next action is a **Ranged Attack** against that target, you get a +3 [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to the [[Stat_DEX | DEX]] Check.
* **Rapid Fire** (Major Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO %}
* **Pinning Shot** (Major Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO %}
* **Double Shot** (Major Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO %}

### Tank Warriors Feats

Tank Warriors focus on Constitution, and thus are focused on defense and therefore do not have a specific weapon focus.

* **Improved Taunt** (Core Major Feat, Level 1): You can spend an additional 1 [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]] as you perform a [[Action_Taunt | Taunt]] action to get a +6 [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to your [[Stat_Intimidation | Intimidation]] Check.
* **Shield Bash++** (Major Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO %}
* **Armor++** (Minor Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO %}
* **Stumble Through Resistance++** (Minor Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO %}

### Martial Warriors Feats

* TODO -- add a Core Minor Feat
* **Exert Authority** (Major Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO %}
* **Distributed Shifts** (Major Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO %}

### Survivalist Warriors Feats

* **Rage** (Core Minor Feat, Level 1): {% TODO %}
* **Specialized Knowledge (Sylvian)** (Minor Feat, Level 2): Exactly the same as the one obtained via the **Sylvian Upbringing**.

### Scoundrel Warriors Feats

* **Fancy Footwork** (Core Minor Feat, Level 1): Same as D&D Swashbuckler.
* **Thieves's Fingers** (Minor Feat, Level 2): lock picking, trap disarming, etc.
* **Leverage** (Major Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO "sneak attack equivalent" %}
* **Skilled** (Major Feat, Level 2+): {% TODO "base bonus on things you are not good at" %}

## Casters

There are a total of 12 **Caster** classes, which are divided in a 3x4 matrix depending on their **Role** (**Primary Attribute** and source of their powers) and **Flavor** (manifestation of that power).

| Role / Flavor  | Arcanist | Mechanist | Naturalist | Musicist    |
|----------------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Erudite (INT)  | Wizard   | Engineer  | Alchemist  | Storyteller |
| Intuitive (WIS)| Mage     | Artificer | Druid      | Minstrel    |
| Innate (CHA)   | Sorcerer | Machinist | Shaman     | Bard        |

The **Core Major Feat** for all **Casters** is:

* **Arcane Casting ([Primary Attribute])** (Major Feat, Level 1) [[Concentration]]: Unlocks Arcane Casting. See [Arcane Spellcasting](/rules/arcane) for details on how the **Arcane** magic system works.

See [Arcane Spellcasting](/rules/arcane) for a detailed breakdown of what each **Role** and **Flavor** entails and how the **Arcane** magic system works.

### The Arcanist

The Arcanist is the generalist **Caster**; they are able to use all types of **Spell Components**, but are not particularly proficient in any of them.

* **Signature Spell ([Spell])** (Core Minor Feat, Level 2): Choose a specific spell (that means specific **Noun**, **Verb**, description, and set of **Augmentations**; see the examples in the [Arcane Spellcasting](/rules/arcane) page; players can work with their DM to define what is specific enough). You have the exact execution step decision tree for this specific spell committed to muscle memory; get a `+3` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] when casting this specific spell.

### The Mechanist

The Mechanist is able to use tools and devices that they can devise to assist with the execution of **Somatic Spell Components**. In contrast, they are unable to use **Verbal** or **Focal** components.

* **Tool-Assisted Casting** (Core Minor Feat, Level 2): You can create and use **One-Handed** (`+2`) and **Two-Handed** (`+3`) tools, crazy mechanical contraptions to assist you with the execution of **Somatic Spell Components**. You can use these tools to execute a **Somatic Component** of any spell, but you cannot use any other type of **Spell Component**.

### The Naturalist

The Naturalist is able to use the natural world around them to assist with the execution of **Somatic Spell Components**. In contrast, they are unable to use **Verbal** or **Focal** components.

* **Focal Connection** (Core Minor Feat, Level 2): You can create and use a personal **Custom Focus** (`+3`) that is bound to you. You can use this **Custom Focus** to execute the **Focal Component** of any spell, but you cannot use any other type of **Spell Component**.
* **Specialized Knowledge (Sylvian)** (Minor Feat, Level 3): Exactly the same as the one obtained via the **Sylvian Upbringing**.

### The Musicist

The Musicist is able to use music and instruments to assist with the execution of **Verbal Spell Components**. In contrast, they are unable to use **Somatic** or **Focal** components.

* **Lyrical Resonance** (Core Minor Feat, Level 2): You can use **One-Handed** (`+2`) and **Two-Handed** (`+3`) instruments to assist you with the execution of **Verbal Spell Components**. You can use these instruments to execute a **Verbal Component** of any spell, but you cannot use any other type of **Spell Component**.

## Mystics

Unlike the **Arcane**, the **Divine** is a much softer magical system, by which **Mystics** use their connection to the **Aether** to outsource the power of external entities (Proteans), their own Soul, or Luck itself. It is definitely _not_ a science, and it is _not_ predictable. Instead of describing exact desired effects as the **Casters** do, **Mystics** have vague desires and roll a Check, letting the DM decide the effect.

There are a total of 9 **Mystic** classes, which are divided in a 3x3 matrix depending on their **Role** (which determines their **Primary Attribute**) and **Flavor** (wether they purely dedicate to their channeling or have some mixed martial characteristics).

| Role / Flavor | Pure     | Mixed     | Martial   |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Adept (DIV)   | Cleric   | Warlock   | Paladin   |
| Disciple (FOW)| Sage     | Monk      | Ranger    |
| Inspired (LCK)| Wanderer | Wayfarer  | Warden    |

The realm of the **Divine** can produce effects much different than that of the **Arcane**, such as:

* Direct Healing and Harming
* Buffs and Debuffs
* Divination (through [[Stat_Revelation | Revelation]])
* Illusions
* Luck Bending

However, differently from the **Casters** table, this matrix is a bit more diverse; each **Role** will have access to different tools and abilities (though some form of **Channeling** will always connect all **Mystics**):

* **The Adept**: Employ their [[Stat_DIV | DIV]] to submit to a specific Protean and channel their power.
* **The Disciple**: Leverage their [[Stat_FOW | FOW]] and self-control to connect to the Aether and channel the true power of their own Soul.
* **The Inspired**: Receive their [[Stat_LCK | LCK]] through a literally unexplainable connection to the Aether (and maybe even beyond).

Therefore, much like it is for the **Warriors**, your **Role** will define your **Core Major Feat**, while your **Flavor** will define your **Core Minor Feat**.

## The Adept

The **Adept** is a **Mystic** who either has (1) submitted, (2) a contract, or (3) a bond with a specific higher power in the **Aether** - i.e., a **Protean**.
The nature of their connection can be varied, from an abstract concept and blind devotion to a more personal touch towards an Avatar (see the **Archetypes** section below for more details).

Regardless of the nature of their connection, the **Adept** can:

* Actively [[Action_Pray | Pray]] as a means of indirect expressing their desires and needs to their **Protean**, using a [[Stat_Devotion | Devotion]] Check;
* Actively **Channel** powers from the **Aether** into the material world (i.e. divine spellcasting); that uses a [[Stat_DIV | DIV]] Check;
* Passively receive messages, guidance, or visions from their **Protean**; that requires a [[Stat_Revelation | Revelation]] Check.

In exchange, they are responsible for respecting and furthering their **Protean**'s cause. Unlike other settings, there is no defined pantheon of impossibly powerful (or even omnipotent) gods. Instead, players should work with their DMs to create **Proteans** as part of their character creation. However, some pre-defined templates will be provided below.

Typically, Adepts will **Pray** once at the start of every day (after a [[Long Rest]]), and they can at this moment express their vague desires, needs, and concerns to their **Protean**. They can attempt to ask for more specific requests, but depending on the type of request, how aligned it is with their **Protean**'s cause, the complexity, specificity and difficulty of the requests, it will be less likely to succeed. Regardless of the ask, the character will do a [[Stat_Devotion | Devotion]] Check, and the DM will rule over the outcome. At this moment, the DM might also request a [[Stat_Revelation | Revelation]] Check, that will determine wether the **Protean** has any messages, visions, omens, guidance or requests.

A character can attempt to **Pray** on any longer moments of peace and quiet (like a [[Short Rest]]), but typically praying more than once a day is infective. Similarly, a DM might request a [[Stat_Revelation | Revelation]] Check at any moment, depending on circumstances, the nature of the **Protean** and the connection, or circumstances and events.

* **Divine Channeling** (Core Major Feat, Level 1) [[Channeling]]: Unlocks Divine Channeling. See [Divine Channeling](/rules/divine) for details on how the **Divine** magic system works.
*

## The Disciple

The **Disciple** is a **Mystic** who is able to channel the power within their **Soul** into the Material World. They are still finely connected and attuned to the **Aether**, but they are not bound to a specific **Protean**, but rather strengthen the connection with their own **Soul**.

* **Flurry of Blows** (Core Major Feat, Level 1) [[Channeling]]: You can spend 1 [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]] to make an unarmed [[Action_Strike | Strike]] cost only 1 [[Resource_Action_Point | AP]].
* **Channeling Fists** (Minor Feat, Level 2) [[Channeling]]: You can spend 1 [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]] to get a +1 [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to an unarmed Attack Check.

## The Inspired

The **Inspired** is a **Mystic** who is able to receive their [[Stat_LCK | LCK]] through an unexplainable connection to the **Aether** (and possibly beyond). If the typical channeling power is vague and abstract, the origin of the good fortune of the **Inspired** is completely beyond comprehension.

* **Bountiful Luck** (Core Major Feat, Level 1) [[Channeling]]: You can spend [[Resource_Spirit_Points | SP]] instead of [[Resource_Heroism_Points | Heroism Points]] to use the [[Action_Karmic_Resistance | Karmic Resistance]], [[Action_Write_History | Write History]] and [[Action_Luck_Die | Luck Die]] actions.

## Flavor: Purist

The **Purists** will be completely focused on their channeling, instead of diverging into more martial-focused faculties.

* **Effortless Imbued Item Channeling** (Core Minor Feat, Level 1): Whenever you would spend [[Resource_Spirit_Point | Spirit Points]] to use an **Imbued Item** that would otherwise not require a [[Stat_Channeling | Channeling]] Check, you can make a [[Stat_Channeling | Channeling]] Check DC 15 to spend one less [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]].
* **Divine Channeling** (Major Feat, Level 2) [[Channeling]]: Unlocks Divine Channeling. See [Divine Channeling](/rules/divine) for details on how the **Divine** magic system works.
* **Focused Channeling** (Minor Feat, Level 3): You can spend 2 [[Resource_Focus_Points | FP]] (and add the [[Concentrate]] trait, if it didn't have it already) when doing an action with the [[Channeling]] trait to get a +3 [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]].

## Flavor: Mixed

The **Mixed** will be in between the Purist and the Martial.

> <mark>WIP</mark> The **Mixed** is still being developed and is not available as an option yet.

## Flavor: Martial

Of the three **Flavors**, the **Martial** will have the most focus on martial expertise, but still being primarily focused on their channeling.

* **Divine Smite** (Core Minor Feat, Level 1) [[Channeling]]: You can spend 2 [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]] when striking with a weapon to get a +3 [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] as you channel raw power into it, making it acquire a distinct glow as you lift it to strike.
* **Spiritual Armor** (Minor Feat, Level 2) [[Channeling]]: You can roll the [[Action_Shrug_Off | Shrug Off]] action using your **Primary Attribute** instead of [[Stat_Toughness | Toughness]].
* **Divine Channeling** (Major Feat, Level 3) [[Channeling]]: Unlocks Divine Channeling. See [Divine Channeling](/rules/divine) for details on how the **Divine** magic system works.

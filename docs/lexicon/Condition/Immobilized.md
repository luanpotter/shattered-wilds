The creature is physically restrained, typically through [[Grapple | grappling]], and thus has limited freedom of movement.

While **Immobilized**, a character:

- Cannot take Movement [[Action | Actions]] (except [[Escape]], or [[Drag Grappler]] if they are grappled).
- Can still take **Attack** [[Action | Actions]] with a `-3` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]].
- Cannot perform **Somatic Spell Components** as they require a greater baseline freedom of movement.
- **Do not** take any penalties to **Body Defense Checks**, but **cannot** take the [[Dodge]] or [[Take Cover]] reactions.

The character is severely incapacitated when their [[Resource_Vitality_Point | VP]], [[Resource_Focus_Point | FP]] or [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]] reaches 0.

When Incapacitated, a character is:

- [[Condition_Prone | Prone]], [[Condition_Immobilized | Immobilized]], and [[Condition_Unconscious | Unconscious]].
- Unable to take [[Action | Actions]] (except [[Action_Heroic_Relentlessness | Heroic Relentlessness]]).
- Helpless and vulnerable to further harm.

When a character recovers from Incapacitated (by any means), they gain one level of [[Consequence/Exhaustion | Exhaustion]]. This represents the physical and mental toll of being pushed to the brink of consciousness.

Incapacitated characters are vulnerable to taking further [[Consequences]].

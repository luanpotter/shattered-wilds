The character is severely incapacitated when their [[Vitality_Point | VP]], [[Focus_Point | FP]] or [[Spirit_Point | SP]] reaches 0.

When Incapacitated, a character is:

- [[Prone]], [[Immobilized]], and [[Unconscious]].
- Unable to take [[Action | Actions]] (except [[Heroic_Relentlessness | Heroic Relentlessness]]).
- Helpless and vulnerable to further harm.

When a character recovers from Incapacitated (by any means), they gain one level of [[Exhaustion]]. This represents the physical and mental toll of being pushed to the brink of consciousness.

Incapacitated characters are vulnerable to taking further Consequences.

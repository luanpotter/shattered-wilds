Your ability to channel messages, visions or revelations from your deity.

**Note**: While a character does not need to be an **Adept** to invest and receive Revelation Checks, they do need to have a connection to at least one **Protean**. If they do not yet have a connection, they might attempt to form a new bond through roleplaying and investing in [[Stat_Devotion | Devotion]].

## Parent Stat

## Example Usages

* A Check can be used when trying to connect to, interpret, or understand your deity.

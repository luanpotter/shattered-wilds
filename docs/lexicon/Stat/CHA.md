**Charisma** is a measure of the [[Stat_Mind | Mind]]'s ability to influence, persuade, inspire, and connect with others, as well as understand emotions (be it your own or others'). Think empathy, magnetism, charm, physical attractiveness.

Unlike on other systems, where Charisma is further broken down into Skills based on _intent of usage_, such as Persuasion, Intimidation, Seduction, etc. In Shattered Wilds, we break it down by means, and different Skills can be used for different intents.

In fact the exact nature of _how_ the Charisma is being applied will determine which are the best Skills to use for certain situations. Depending on the flavor and roleplaying, all 3 Skills can be used for most intents. The table below gives some guidance on which Skills are better suited for which intents. This also includes a column for potential Extras to be used in such rolls.

| Function   | Speechcraft | Presence | Empathy | Extra              |
|------------|-------------|----------|---------|--------------------|
| Intimidate |  0          | +1       | -1      | [[Stat_STR | STR]] |
| Deceive    | +1          | -1       |  0      | [[Stat_WIS | WIS]] |
| Persuade   | +1          | -1       |  0      | [[Stat_INT | INT]] |
| Inspire    |  0          | -1       | +1      | [[Stat_DIV | DIV]] |
| Beguile    | -1          | +1       |  0      | [[Stat_FOW | FOW]] |
| Seduce     | -1          | +1       |  0      | [[Stat_DEX | DEX]] |

Similarly, the different Skills can be used for different types of performances:

| Performances       | Speechcraft | Presence | Empathy | Extra              |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|---------|--------------------|
| Singing            | +1          | -1       |  0      | [[Stat_CON | CON]] |
| Playing Instrument | +1          | -1       |  0      | [[Stat_INT | INT]] |
| Dancing            | -1          | +1       |  0      | [[Stat_DEX | DEX]] |
| Acting             | +1          | +1       | -1      | [[Stat_FOW | FOW]] |
| Storytelling       | +1          | -1       |  0      | [[Stat_WIS | WIS]] |

If you want to be particularly good at a specific type of performance, you can get the appropriate Minor Feat.

On top of these types of actions, the different Skills can still be used for other purposes; for example, [[Stat_Empathy | Empathy]] can be used to read emotions or figure out if someone is lying or has hidden intents; [[Stat_Speechcraft | Speechcraft]] can be used to craft poems and texts with specific artistic or practical intents; and [[Stat_Presence | Presence]] can be used to command attention or exert authority over crowds.

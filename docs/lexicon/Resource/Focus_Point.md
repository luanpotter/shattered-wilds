A **Focus Point (FP)** is a [[Resource]] that represents a character's mental vigor and ability to focus during intense situations. They are analogous to Mana in other games for Arcane casters, but they are also used by any characters to power special abilities that require focus, mental acuity and concentration. You have a max Focus Points equal to 4 + your [[Mind]] modifier. You can lose Focus Points when you are [[Condition_Distracted | distracted]].

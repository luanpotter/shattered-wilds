A **Heroism Point (HP)** is a [[Resource]] that represents a character's heroic potential and determination. Each character has a maximum number of Heroism Points equal to their Level value. They can be used to invoke Extras and Luck, to call for Write History, amongst other powerful actions. These are harder to recover, at one per long rest rate plus the DM can award Heroism Points (within your maximum) to reward good roleplaying or other out-of-the-box thinking (similar to the Inspiration mechanic in D&D 5e).

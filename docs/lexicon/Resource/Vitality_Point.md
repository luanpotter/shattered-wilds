A **Vitality Point (VP)** is a [[Resource]] that represents a character's physical ability to keep going during intense situations. They are analogous to Health in other games, but in the D12 System, you only take real damage after you are [[Condition_Incapacitated | Incapacitated]]. You have a max Vitality Points equal to 4 + your [[Body]] modifier. You lose Vitality when you are attacked, and they can also be spent to power special abilities.

Represents a longer term form of tiredness and fatigue that cannot be healed by a simple [[Short Rest]]. Exhaustion comes in _ranks_, each character starting at 0 _ranks_ of **Exhaustion**.

Several different circumstances can increase the _rank_; initially, just accumulating without causing harm, but further _ranks_ will incur negative consequences. Up to `3` ranks of **Exhaustion** are cleared on each [[Long Rest]].

Circumstances that cause the _rank_ of Exhaustion to increase include:

* Completing a [[Short Rest]];
* Being cleared from [[Incapacitated]];
* Failing to perform a [[Long Rest]] at the end of the day.

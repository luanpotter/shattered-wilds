Exhaustion represents a slightly longer term form of tiredness that cannot be healed by a simple Short Rest. Exhaustion comes in **levels**, each character starting at 0 Levels of Exhaustion.

Several different circumstances can increase the level of Exhaustion. While the initial levels of Exhaustion just accumulate without causing negative consequences, further levels will incur negative consequences. Exhaustion is cleared on a Long Rest.

Circumstances that cause the level of Exhaustion to increase include:

* Being cleared from [[Condition_Incapacitated | Incapacitated]].
* Short Rest (?) - not sure yet
* TODO: more

Exhaustion Levels and their effects:

* Levels 0-2: No effects.

A non-trivial amount of toxin lingers on your system. Your maximum [[Vitality_Point | VP]] is reduced by your [[Poisoned]] _rank_ (if it reaches `0`, you die from the poison).

In order to treat it, a more advanced level of medical care is required than a simple [[Short Rest]], but the exact requirements depend on the nature of the poison. Typically, during a [[Long Rest]], you or someone can attempt to use a Healer's Kit ([[Intuition]] Check DC 20 (Medium)) to reduce the _rank_ of Poisoned by 1 + **Shifts**.

Alongside Stats, a character also has a set of **Feats**, which can represent a wide variety of abilities, modifiers and actions. Typically, a Player character will start with a set of **Core Feats** (based on their **Race/Upbringing** and **Class**) and gain one Feat per level, either a **Minor Feat** (on odd levels starting on Level 1) or a **Major Feat** (on even levels starting on Level 2).

* **Core Feats** are predefined and _mandatory_ **Feats** provided by your choice of **Race/Upbringing** (at Level 0) and **Class** (at Level 1).
* **Minor Feats** will typically give [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to a certain Checks under certain circumstances; though they can also grant more qualitative minor benefits.
* **Major Feats** typically allow you to perform a unique action, be it an actual [[Action]] during an Encounter, or just the ability of doing something (such as _Dark Vision_). These are more qualitative in nature - though the lines can be blurry.

The reason **Minor** and **Major** feats are separated, is to allow Players to actually choose **Minor Feats** every other level. For example, in D&D 5e, if you pick the [Chef](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:chef) Feat, you are probably "underpowered". By having separated "slots", Players will be able to pick **Minor Feats** without being tempted into over-optimizing for combat damage, while still getting their **Major Feat** every other level as well.

A character can definitely choose to fill a **Major Feat** slot with a **Minor Feat** if they really want to, but not the other way around.

## Character Progression

The character progression, then, is as follows:

### Level 0

At **Level 0**, the character is still a **Peasant** and not actually a **Hero** (PCs start at **Level 1**). However at **Level 0** a character will choose their **Race** and **Upbringing** and thus receive, from their **Race**:

* The **Racial Modifiers** (Core Feat);

And from their **Upbringing**:

* The **Upbringing Modifiers** (Core Feat);
* The **Specialized Knowledge ([Upbringing])** (Core Feat);
* A specific **Core Feat** related to their **Upbringing**.

Check the [Races](/rules/races) page for more details.

### Level 1

At **Level 1**, a character becomes a **Hero**, picks their **Class**, and receives their two **Core Class Feats**.  They will also get the **Class Modifier (Primary Attribute)** (Core Feat) which is a `+1` bonus to their class's **Primary Attribute**.

At **Level 1**, the character will also receive their first **Minor Feat**, which they can pick from either their **Class** or **General Feats** lists (though typically **Classes** will not have any Level 1 **Feats**).

### Level 2+

Starting on **Level 2** and on every other even Level, the character will pick a **Major Feat** from their **Class** or **General Feats** lists.

Starting on **Level 3** and on every other odd Level, the character will pick a **Minor Feat** from their **Class** or **General Feats** lists.

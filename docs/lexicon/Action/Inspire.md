Make an [[Stat_Empathy | Empathy]] Check DC `20` (Medium; target can resist with [[Stat_Resolve | Resolve]] if they so desire): target gets a `+1` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to a Attack or Defense action of their choice until the end of their next turn. **Crit Shifts** grant additional modifiers.
Apply a `-3` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] if they cannot see you.
Apply a `-6` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] for each additional target you are trying to inspire at once.

**Write History** allows you to spend [[Resource_Heroism_Point | Heroism Points]] to influence the narrative and create fortunate coincidences in the world around you.

When you use Write History, you spend 1+ [[Resource_Heroism_Point | HP]] and propose to the DM that a fact about the world is true. It can be about history, about the existence of some item or person in the current city, about the geography and map and lore about the nearby map.

Anything can be proposed, but there are a few rules:

* It must not contradict anything that was already established to the players
* It must not contradict or interact with any key plans the DM has that have not yet been established to the player

That means the DM can deny any request w/o any further comments. If the change is acceptable, though, the DM will accept the proposal and counter-offer it with a [[Stat_Serendipity | Serendipity]] Check DC, depending on:

* how close to true the fact already is
* how convenient it would be if it were true
* how absurd it would be for it to be true

The player can then accept the offer or offer a counter-counter proposal, by suggesting:

* a slightly more reasonable version of the request
* a different skill/check to be used
* a different DC

With supporting arguments/evidence. This can go back and forth until the DM has the final say on the DC. The Player must make this roll without using any [[Action_Luck_Die | Luck Die]] or [[Action_Extra_Die | Extra Die]] on this roll.

Depending on the level of success or failure (eg how close to the DC it was), the DM will decide:

* complete failure, nothing happens
* partial failure, the DM picks a weaker/monkey-pawed version of the fact
* success, the player gets the exact fact as agreed
* complete success, the player might get a perk on top of the fact

The DM doesn't necessarily need to tell the player immediately which level of success was obtained.

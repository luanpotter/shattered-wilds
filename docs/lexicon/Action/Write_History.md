**Write History** allows you to spend [[Resource_Heroism_Point | Heroism Points]] to influence the narrative and create fortunate coincidences in the world around you.

When you use Write History, you spend 1 [[Resource_Heroism_Point | HP]] and make a [[Stat_Serendipity | Serendipity]] check. The DM sets the difficulty based on how significant the change you want to make is. Success allows you to establish a minor fact about the world, create a fortunate coincidence, or influence events in your favor.

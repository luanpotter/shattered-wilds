A special Action you can take as a full-round-action when you are [[Condition_Incapacitated | Incapacitated]] by paying a [[Resource_Heroism_Point | Heroism Point]] to make a [[Stat_FOW | FOW]] Check DC 25 (Hard). Restore your [[Resource_Vitality_Point | Vitality]], [[Resource_Focus_Point | Focus]] and [[Resource_Spirit_Point | Spirit]] Points to at least 1 each, thus clearing [[Condition_Incapacitated | Incapacitated]] (you get a level of [[Consequence_Exhaustion | Exhaustion]] as usual).

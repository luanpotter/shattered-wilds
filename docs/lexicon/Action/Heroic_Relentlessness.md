A special Action you can take as a full-round action when you are [[Condition_Incapacitated | Incapacitated]] by paying a [[Resource_Heroism_Point | Heroism Point]] to make a Hard FOW Check (DC 25). Restore your [[Resource_Vitality_Point | Vitality]], [[Resource_Focus_Point | Focus]] and [[Resource_Spirit_Point | Spirit]] Points to at least 1 each, thus clearing [[Condition_Incapacitated | Incapacitated]] (you get a level of Exhaustion as usual).

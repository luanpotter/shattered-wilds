The **Extra Die** is a special mechanic that allows you to enhance your **Active Skill Checks** by leveraging a different **Attribute** alongside your main **Skill**.

For example, imagine you are trying to deceive a guard with a [[Speechcraft]] check, but you have a high [[WIS]]. You can leverage your **Wisdom score** to complement your **Speechcraft Check** by paying 1 [[Heroism_Point | Heroism Point]]. You then roll an extra, visually distinct `d12` for the **Check**.

In order for this extra die to be valid, it must be less or equal than the Attribute chosen as the **Extra**. If it is, that is a valid ***Extra Die** that can be picked as one of the two for the final total. Note that, regardless if you pick the extra die or even if it is valid or not, it still counts for **Crit Modifiers** and **Auto Fail** when applicable.

The **Extra Die** must be invoked before the roll is made.

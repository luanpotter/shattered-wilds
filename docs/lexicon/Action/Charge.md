(this is a combined Movement + Attack action): Move `Speed + 1` hexes in a straight line, followed by Melee Attack with [[Stat_Muscles | Muscles]] instead of [[Stat_STR | STR]]. This can be used for a "Tackle" if the "Shove" Attack Action is chosen, in which case a Circumstance Bonus of +3 is granted to the attacker.

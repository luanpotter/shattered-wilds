You can prepare a specific Action to be executed during the next round as a reaction. You must pay 1 extra [[Action_Point | AP]] to prepare, plus the AP associated with the Action you are preparing now, and will be **Concentrating** and cannot take any other Action or Reaction until your trigger procs during the next round. You will be Concentrating during this period and therefore can lose the action if you become [[Distracted]]. Depending on the complexity of the trigger, the DM might need to ask for an [[IQ]], [[Perception]], or some other check to determine your ability to properly react to your trigger.

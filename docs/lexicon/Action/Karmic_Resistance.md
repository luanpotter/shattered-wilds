The **Karmic Resistance** is a special mechanic that allows you to spend 1 [[Resource_Heroism_Point | Heroism Point]] to resist an effect that requires a **Contested Check** by calling upon your [[Stat_Karma | Karma]] skill instead. You cannot use [[Action_Luck_Die | Luck Die]] or [[Action_Extra_Die | Extra Die]] on this roll.

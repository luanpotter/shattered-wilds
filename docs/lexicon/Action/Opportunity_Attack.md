Triggered by an opponent either (1) leaving your threat area or (2) performing an action on your threat area that triggers an opportunity attack (such as concentrating or channeling). You can choose what kind of Melee Basic Attack to perform as your opportunity attack (this will cost the same amount of AP as that Action would).

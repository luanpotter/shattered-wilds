The **Luck Die** is a special mechanic that allows you to enhance your Active Checks by calling upon your [[Fortune]] skill.

When you make an **Active Check**, you may spend 1 [[Heroism Point]] to roll an additional d12 alongside your normal check. See the [Rules > Basics](/rules/basics) section for details.

In order for this extra die to be valid, it must be less or equal than the character's [[Fortune]] score. If it is, that is a valid **Luck Die** that can be picked as one of the two for the final total. Note that, regardless if you pick the **Luck Die** or even if it is valid or not, it still counts for **Crit Modifiers** and **Auto Fail** when applicable.

The **Luck Die** must be invoked before the roll is made.

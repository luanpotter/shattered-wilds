The Luck Die is a special mechanic that allows you to enhance your Active Checks by calling upon your [[Stat_Fortune | Fortune]] skill.

When you make an Active Check, you may spend 1 [[Resource_Heroism Point | Heroism Point]] to roll an additional d12 alongside your normal check. See the [Rules > Basics](/rules/basics) section for more information.

TODO -- fill this out

The Luck Die can only be used on Active Checks that you initiate - it cannot be used on Contested Checks where you are the defender, Passive Checks, or reactions to other characters' actions.

Consequences are longer-term harms and injuries incurred to creatures that do not get cleared on a simple Short Rest. Consequences involve a specific penalty and specific ways to treat it (normally this can take a longer amount of time). There is not a set number of Consequences one can have, though as they start to severely debilitated, you might incur the ultimate consequence: [[Death]].

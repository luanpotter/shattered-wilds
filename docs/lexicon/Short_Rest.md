Can be performed throughout the day by resting for 30 minutes of peace. Every time the characters perform a **Short Rest**, they can choose to gain a _rank_ of [[Exhaustion]] in order to recover all their [[Resource | Resource Points]] (except for [[Heroism_Point | Heroism Points]]).

Note that the first two _ranks_ of [[Exhaustion]] grant no penalties, and _ranks_ can be cleared by performing a [[Long Rest]] at the end of the day.

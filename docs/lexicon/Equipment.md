Equipments can be used to add [[Circumstance Modifier | CM (Circumstance Modifiers)]] to different checks, typically **Attack** Checks (for Weapons), **[[Body]] Defense** Checks (for **Armor** and **Shields**), and [**Arcane Spell Casting**](/rules/arcane) Checks (for **Wands**, **Staves**, and other **Arcane Foci**).

# Weapons

Unlike other games, weapons don't have separate damage dice, as damage is determined by **Shifts**. Every weapon can be simply described by its **Primary Weapon Type** (which defines the **Base Attribute** use for its [[Check]]), its **Weapon Bonus**, and any special traits it has (such as [[Two-Handed]]). The Weapon Bonus is the final value to be added to your attack roll [[Check]], which will be a [[STR]] or [[DEX]] roll + [weapon bonus] (+ [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]]).

Different **Primary Weapon Types** have different "power tiers". This means that two similarly rare weapons of different types will _typically_ have different bonuses. For example, a common _Dagger (Light Melee)_ will be have a +3 bonus, while a common _Longsword (Heavy Melee)_ will have a +8 bonus, because a _Longsword_ is inherently more powerful. However, rarer and more powerful weapons of any kind can have higher bonuses, and the weapon bonus is the only modifier that matters for your Basic Attack Check. So a _Dagger +10_ has the same bonus as a _Longsword +10_, but finding or forging such a powerful dagger would be much more difficult.

| Primary Weapon Type | Base Attribute | Power Tier |
|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| Unarmed             | [[STR]]        | T0         |
| Thrown              | [[STR]]        | T1         |
| Light Melee         | [[DEX]]        | T2         |
| Ranged              | [[DEX]]        | T2         |
| Heavy Melee         | [[STR]]        | T3         |

The list below contains an assortment of common weapons that could be find in blacksmiths and shops on a typical village. As players explore, they might encounter more powerful versions or more exotic weapon types. Note that this list contains slightly broad category of weapons but the exact flavor can be changed (e.g. a **Spear** can be a _Glaive_ or a _Halberd_, a **Longsword** can be a _Bastard Sword_ or a _Claymore_, etc.).

* **Unarmed**: Unarmed ([[STR]]), +0
* **Shield Bash**: Unarmed ([[STR]]) +1

# Armor

Similarly to Weapons, a piece of Armor is described by its Armor Bonus, and any special traits (typically a [[DEX]] penalty).

# Shields

Shields can be used to perform the Shield Block reaction. Note that they do not confer any other bonuses (other than being able to be used as a weapon for a Shield Bash).

# Arcane Foci

[[Arcanist]] and [[Mechanist]] **Casters** can use tools to assist them in casting spells. These tools are called **Arcane Foci** and allow the **Caster** to use a **Focal Component**. That will require spending a certain number of [[Spirit_Point | Spirit Points]] to activate (typically 1 [[Spirit_Point | SP]]). Essentially, the **Caster** is connecting (a very weak form of **Channeling**) to the **Focal Component** to activate it in the correct way. That still requires mental concentration, as the **Foci** need to be instructed on the exact nature of the required vibrations, and therefore cannot be used by non-Casters. That also cannot be done while [[Distraught]], as it does require [[Channeling]].

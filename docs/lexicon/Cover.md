When there is not a clear line of sight for a ranged attack, there are enemies or allies in the way, or the target is adjacent to a wall, you automatically benefit from **Passive Cover** against ranged attacks.

Passive Cover will grant you a [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to your **Basic Body Defense** against **Ranged Attacks**:

{% list "Cover", "order" %}

If the line of sight is completely obstructed, obviously the attack cannot be performed at all (regardless of the [[Disregard Cover]] feat).

Note that on top of the **Passive Cover**, a target might want to react with the [[Take Cover]] reaction when applicable.

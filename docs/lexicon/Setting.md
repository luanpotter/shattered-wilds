In **Shattered Wilds**, the world is ever-shifting. Not fast enough that you could see - but within a few weeks or months, routes between settlements could be lost; rivers could change course, mountains could start to emerge or dwindle back into the ground; forests could wander, and trails could lead to new places and ruins that hadn't been seen for ages. The only constants are the settlements, villages, towns, cities or any sufficient congregation of people - those are stable and do not move. But the routes between them are always changing, compasses are useless (always spinning seemingly at random), and maps become outdated quickly after they are drawn.

Travel, therefore, is a risky proposition. The Wilds, when uncharted, are perilous, presenting harsh conditions for the unprepared, and filled with dangerous creatures - both beasts and people - and of course, the [[Setting_Hollow | Hollow]]. Adventurers double as cartographers, and venture forth into the wild to establish new temporary routes, to allow for bursts of commerce and passage for the common folk, at least for a brief period of time. Some strong enough to withstand the Wilds choose to live by themselves; others form parties to explore and learn more about the world.

On smaller settlements, such as the villages the players are from, or the one they shall gather on, knowledge is not lacking but limited. People know of stories of the world and the past, but many have never left their birthplaces. Well-known in all villages is the elusive city known simply as the **The Citadel**, a huge and prosperous settlement where members of all races live in harmony, and where magic and technology flourish. It is possible to find some that claimed to have been there, and while they are rare in each village, the knowledge of its existence is not disputed. Getting there, however, as with any traveling, is a different matter entirely.

Smaller villages often house a majority of one or two races, but the others are common enough occurrences to be known. As even the smallest village can be a pivotal point in the paths of many travelers and adventurers, the commoners are not stranger to seeing adventurers, other people, heroes or magic, though very powerful champions are exceedingly rare.

## Known Tropes

Some known tropes from other high-fantasy TTRPG settings that are not present or are different in Shattered Wilds:

* there is no teleportation of matter or energy
* action-at-a-distance is limited to the Aether, and even then, it is not infinite
* gods (the Protean) are not all-powerful and definitely not omnipresent, though they can be very powerful
* there is no known way to resurrect the dead; once a mortal spark is severed from its body, while it can linger in the Aether for a few minutes, it will eventually fade away

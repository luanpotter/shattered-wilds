Last but not least, a key aspect for **Shattered Wilds** is to define a character's **Personality**.

While Shattered Wilds does not feature a strict _Alignment System_, such as D&D, and players are welcome to define any aspects of their character's personality as they see fit, this section provides a set of baselines for important traits to choose.

## Calling

On a typical **Shattered Wilds** campaign, the goal of each character is to reach the **Citadel** - a legendary city of flourishing culture, science and magic. However, each character should have a different specific reason (called their **Calling**) for reaching it (which they can keep in secret from other players if desired).

## Vice

For roleplaying purposes, your character should have at least one **Vice** - an indulgence, temptation, flaw, or urge that they have a hard time resisting. The DM might ask for a [[Discipline]] Check whenever your character finds themselves tempted by their **Vice**.

## Aversion

Similarly, your character should have at least one **Aversion** - something they cannot bring themselves to do, either because of a moral edict, an intense dislike, fear or disgust, or some other reason. Depending on the type of **Aversion**, the character might also need to roll a [[Discipline]] Check if they are attempting to go against their **Aversion**.

Note that for **Mystics**, and in particular, **Disciples**, some **Aversions** can be inherited or shared with their **Protean's** codes and rules. If they share an **Aversion**, they can roll [[Devotion]] instead of [[Discipline]] for the Check.

## Tenet

As opposed to **Aversions**, **Tenets** are rules and edicts that a character must always follow. These are most typically due to moral reasons, strongly held personal beliefs, or imposed by their **Protean**. Tenets can be optional, if you feel it is more suited for your character to not have any strong moral convictions.

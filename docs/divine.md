Unlike the **Arcane**, the **Divine** is a much softer magical system, by which characters outsource power through the **Aether** (be it from Proteans, their own Soul, or an inexplicable connection to Luck itself). **Divine** is definitely _not_ a science, and it is _not_ predictable. Instead of describing exact desired effects as the **Arcanists** do, **Mystics** state vague desires and roll a Check, letting the DM decide the effect.

_This is the choice for players who want a more loosey-goosey, less mechanical magic system._

The domain of the **Divine** also includes [[Imbued Item | Imbued Items]], as they work by leveraging powers from the **Aether**.

**Mystics** with the [[Divine Channeling]] **Feat** can spend 2 [[Action_Point | AP]] and any number (at least 1, at most your [[Level]]) of [[Spirit_Point | SP]] to perform a specific **Divine Channeling** action (with the [Channeling] trait) to essentially "cast a divine spell". Roll a [[DIV]] Check (regardless of **Class**) and the DM will determine the effect based on the result.

## Domains

**Divine Channeling** is a plea to the forces of the beyond to grant a desired effect. The vaguer the request, the more likely it is for it to succeed in some form or another.

As such, there is no pre-defined "spell list"; the **Mystic** can choose to cast a **Pure Divine Channeling**, which is basically an unspecific plea for help of any kind, or ask for specific effects depending on the **Aspects** of their **Protean**. While extremely specific effects (akin to the **Arcane** casting) are nearly impossible, it is possible to at least specify the general nature of the desired effect.

The exact nature and capabilities of **Divine Channeling** are vague and flexible. Effect types that are covered by the **Arcane** are usually beyond the domain of the **Divine**. In contrast, effects from the list below are known to be possible:

* Healing of [[Vitality_Point | VP]] or [[Focus_Point | FP]] (the **Divine** cannot heal [[Spirit_Point | SP]]);
* Damaging of [[Vitality_Point | VP]] or [[Spirit_Point | SP]] (the **Divine** cannot harm [[Focus_Point | FP]]);
* Infliction or removal of [[Condition | Conditions]], notably [[Blessed]] and [[Frightened]];
* Imbuement of items (temporarily), granting boons or extra powers (often requiring [[Spirit_Point | SP]] to activate);
* Divination of the possible futures, the present or the past (note: this is the vaguest type of **Channeling**, and asking for very specific questions is extremely hard; also no **Protean** is omniscient);
* Creation of illusions, such as the **Minor Illusion** spell in D&D; in combat, barriers, camouflage or even forms of invisibility are possible (the latter being particularly hard).

Within those, the actual scope of possible effects will largely depend on the **Aspects** of the specific **Protean**.

## Targets

Most Divine Channeling effects are directed to a specific target, that the **Mystic** must visualize in their plea. Depending on the type of effect, targets can be:

* Self
* A specific creature
* A specific item
* Allies in general
* Foes in general
* A Hex where something will appear or happen

Regardless of the target, the **Mystic** can comfortably target anything within their [[Influence Range]]. Anything beyond that will be extremely hard to accomplish, requiring truly heroic rolls to succeed.

## Protean Archetypes

The exact nature of your connection to a **Protean** can be whatever you want for your character; below are a few archetypical suggestions.

* **The Absent God**: This is a typical religious archetype; your Protean is a distant and unknowable force for which you can pray and hope that they will keep granting you their favor and power. They often do not respond directly, or do so through mysterious means, and often you belong to a larger cult, that tries to study and understand this being. This kind of **Protean** is often much stronger but less personal and dedicated to your success. Edicts of this faith are normally broad concepts and negative moral rules, such as "never lie" or "only attack someone who attacks you first", and can often include many smaller rules, rituals and practices.
* **The Devil's Contract**: Your connection entirely revolves around a very specific contract that you signed with a higher being; the specifications of what you must do are very clear, often in the form of positive requirements, such as "you must do X at least once every day", but can also include other types of rules. Typically you are aware of at least an Avatar of your **Protean**, that you have personally met to sign he contract and can meet again, but that is a rare occasion.
* **The Guardian Angel**: Your Protean, typically a less powerful being, has a much more direct connection with you, as it is the case that you have met several times. They might sporadically ask you specific requests during the adventure to prove your fealty, and be more willing to respond directly to requests, but likely their influence is more limited.
* **The Unseen Force**: You don't really know the exact nature of your **Protean**, or where your powers come from, you just feel imbued with powers and have strong convictions about how to tame, maintain and appease them. You might not believe the powers come from a **Protean** at all, but you know they are being imbued onto you from something or somewhere. This archetype might require more unusual forms of Devotion, such as "you must drink someone else's blood at least once every day", "you must slay every hoofed beast on sight", but it can also have more vague obligations. These rules are felt as intuitions on your Soul, and whether or not to question them when inconvenient is always on your mind.
* **The Moral Covenant**: Your connection represents itself as an impersonal moral code that you are compelled to follow at all costs; similar to the **Unseen Force**, you do not know the exact nature or form of your **Protean**, but you know that this covenant has been established between you and some higher power. You do not know why, or how, but you know that you must abide by it.

Feel free to mix and match or come up with any archetype that fits your character with the DM. The key points to settle are:

* How do you connect with your **Protean**, have you seen them, heard them, do you just feel them, do you just pray to them? If you know them as an "individual", what are they like, what is their personality?
* What are the rules that you must follow, either positive or negative rules, are they specific or vague, how do you know them, how flexible are they?
* What **Aspects** does your **Protean** represent, and which ones do they frown upon? Usually it is recommended for a **Protean** to represent 2-3 **Aspects** and to frown upon one other, ideally tied to their rules.

An important topic to keep in mind is how your **Protean's** rules and **Aspects** align with your character's [Personality](/rules/personality), specifically with their [[Vice | Vices]] and [[Aversion | Aversions]] (they might or might not align, but bear in mind the consequences of these choices for roleplay).

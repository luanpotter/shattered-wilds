Unlike the Arcane, the Divine is a much softer magical system, by which characters outsource the power of external entities (be it Proteans, powerful Beings, or greater unknown forces). Essentially they use their Soul to connect to the Aether and extract power from it.

Divine is definitely not a science, and it is not predictable. Instead of describing exact desired effects as the Arcanists do, Mystics have vague desires and roll a Check, letting the DM decide the effect.

Mystics are also more diverse in their classes, depending on their primary attribute:

* **Disciple**: Employ their [[DIV]] to submit to a specific Protean
* **Adept**: Leverage their [[FOW]] and self-control to connect to the Aether
* **Inspired**: Receive their [[LCK]] through an unexplainable connection to the Aether

Each Role also has 3 Flavor options, depending on how much they dedicate to channeling versus other skills:

| Role / Flavor | Pure     | Mixed     | Martial   |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Adept (DIV)   | Cleric   | Warlock   | Paladin   |
| Disciple (FOW)| Sage     | Monk      | Ranger    |
| Inspired (LCK)| Wanderer | Wayfarer  | Warden    |

## Divine Spells

The realm of the Divine can produce effects much different than that of the Arcane, such as:

* Direct Healing and Harming
* Buffs and Debuffs
* Divination
* Illusions

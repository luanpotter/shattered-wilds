Unlike the **Arcane**, the **Divine** is a much softer magical system, by which characters outsource the power through the **Aether** (be it from Proteans, their own Soul, or an unexplainable connection to Luck itself). **Divine** is definitely _not_ a science, and it is _not_ predictable. Instead of describing exact desired effects as the **Arcanists** do, **Mystics** have vague desires and roll a Check, letting the DM decide the effect.

**Mystics** with the **Divine Channeling** **Feat** can spend 1 [[Action_Point | AP]] and any number (at least 1, at most your [[Level]]) of [[Spirit_Point | SP]] to perform a specific **Divine Channeling** action (with the [Channeling] trait) to basically cast a "divine spell". Roll a [[DIV]] Check (regardless of your **Class**) and the DM will determine the effect based on the result.

All divine spells are pleas to the forces of the beyond to grant a desired effect. The vaguer the request, the more likely it is for it to succeed in some form or another. While very specific spell effects (akin to the **Arcane** casting) are not possible, it is possible to at least specify the general nature of the desired effect.

In a similar vein, effect types that are covered by the **Arcane** are not achievable through **Channeling**. Effects such as **Conjuration**, **Telekinesis**, and any of the **Arcane Schools** are beyond the realm of the **Divine**.

The possible realm of effects of **Divine Channeling** specifically includes:

* Direct Healing & Harming
* Buffs & Debuffs
* Divination
* Illusions, including Invisibility

Note that the nature of the specific **Protean** can also influence which types of effects are likely to be granted.

However, there is no pre-defined spell list; the **Mystic** can choose to cast a **Pure Divine Channeling**, which is basically a unspecific plea for help, or add **Specifiers**, starting by invoking a command word, and then potentially adding even more detail. Some (definitely not exhaustive) suggestions are:

### Heal

A plea to heal you or your allies of some [[Vitality_Point | VP]] or [[Focus_Point | FP]]. Specifiers can include what type of resource to heal, the target and how much.

### Harm

A plea to harm your foes. Specifiers can include what type of harm to inflict, the target, and how much.

### Bless

A plea to bless you or your allies, clearing negative [[Condition | Conditions]] or granting a temporary positive [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to their **Attack Checks**.

### Desecrate

A plea to desecrate your foes, afflicting them with negative [[Condition | Conditions]] such as [[Silenced]], [[Blinded]], [[Off_Guard | Off Guard]], [[Distracted]] or [[Distraught]] or giving them a temporary negative [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to their **Attack Checks**.

### Protect

A plea to protect you or your allies from harm; this will add a temporary [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to some of their **Defense Checks**.

### Deceive

A plea to create an **Illusion**. Specifiers can include what type of illusion to create, the target, and how long the illusion lasts.

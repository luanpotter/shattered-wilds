# Races

There are 7 humanoid races in the world of Shattered Wilds, all belonging to the same humanoid species. These are all the rational material Beings known to exist, and they seen to share a common ancestry, though the details have been lost to time.

| Race   | Physical Stats | Size |
|--------|----------------|------|
| Human  | Neutral        | M    |
| Elf    | +DEX, -CON     | M    |
| Dwarf  | +CON, -DEX     | S    |
| Orc    | +STR, -DEX     | L    |
| Fey    | +DEX, -STR     | S    |
| Goliath| +STR, -CON     | L    |
| Tellur | +CON, -STR     | S    |

A character's race grants them some physical stat changes (these changes will bypass level cap) and a size category.

The Size category determines the Size Modifier which is used in a few derived attributes and checks on the character sheet:

| Size | Modifier |
|------|----------|
| Fine | -8       |
| Diminutive | -4       |
| Tiny | -2       |
| Small | -1       |
| Medium | 0        |
| Large | 1        |
| Huge | 2        |
| Gargantuan | 4        |
| Colossal | 8        |

Characters can also be half-breed. While typically peoples breed within their own, all races are compatible so you can have a double ancestry (you could theoretically be a convoluted mix, but there are no specific rules for that - eventually races even out to Human). If a character picks two races, they will be considered a Half-X Half-Y, where X is their primary race.

A character gets the size of their primary race and they can decide to get the combined physical stat modifiers or just the primary race ones. So for example if they want to be a Half-Goliath Half-Dwarf, they will be Large and can decide either to get +1 STR / -1 CON or combined +1 STR / - 1 DEX. DM allowing you might make different choices (e.g. get your size category to be the "average" between races or get the stats strictly from your secondary race). Half Breeds are not completely uncommon but can be seen as outsiders for members of either races, specially if they are sufficiently physically different to be easily noticeable.

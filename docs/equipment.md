# Equipment

Equipments can be used to add Circumstance Modifiers to different checks, notably Attack Checks (for Weapons), Body Defense Checks (for Armor)

## Weapons

Unlike other games, weapons don't have separate damage dice, as damage is determined by Shifts. Every weapon can be simply described by its Primary Weapon Type (which defines the Base Attribute), its Weapon Bonus, and any special traits it has. The Weapon Bonus is the final value to be added to your attack roll, which will be a STR or DEX roll + [weapon bonus].

Different Primary Weapon Types have different "power levels". This means that two similarly rare weapons of different types will typically have different bonuses. For example, a common Dagger (Light Melee) will be have a +3 bonus, while a common Longsword (Heavy Melee) will have a +8 bonus, because a Longsword is inherently more powerful. However, rarer and more powerful weapons of any kind can have higher bonuses, and the weapon bonus is the only modifier that matters for your Basic Attack Check. So a Dagger +10 has the same bonus as a Longsword +10, but finding or forging such a powerful dagger would be much more difficult.

| Primary Weapon Type | Base Attribute | Power Level |
|---------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Unarmed             | STR or DEX     | 0           |
| Thrown              | STR            | 1           |
| Light Melee         | DEX            | 2           |
| Ranged              | DEX            | 2           |
| Heavy Melee         | STR            | 3           |

The list below contains an assortment of common weapons that could be find in blacksmiths and shops on a typical village. As players explore, they might encounter more powerful versions or more exotic weapon types. Note that this list contains slightly broad category of weapons but the exact flavor can be changed (e.g. a Spear can be a Glaive or a Halberd, a Longsword can be a Bastard Sword or a Claymore, etc.).

* **Shield Bash**: Unarmed (STR) +1
* **Javelin**: Thrown +2 (Range 7m)
* **Hatchet**: Light Melee +2, Thrown +3 (Range 5m) (Hand Axe)
* **Dagger**: Light Melee +3, Thrown +2 (Range 5m) [Concealable] (Knife)
* **Rapier**: Light Melee +4 (Short Sword)
* **Spear**: Heavy Melee +5 [Polearm] [Two-Handed] (Glaive, Halberd, Pike)
* **Mace**: Heavy Melee +5 (Club, Mace, Morningstar)
* **Longsword**: Heavy Melee +6 [Two-Handed] (Bastard Sword, Claymore)

* **Crossbow & Darts**: Ranged +4 (Range 20m) [Two-Handed (for Reloading)][Reload] (Light Crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, Hand Crossbow)

## Armor

Similarly to Weapons, Armor is described by its Armor Bonus, and any special traits (typically a DEX penalty).

* **Light Armor** +1 (Leather Armor)
* **Medium Armor** +3, -1 DEX (Chainmail)
* **Heavy Armor** +5, -3 DEX (Full Plate)

## Shields

Shields can be used to perform the Shield Block reaction. Note that they do not confer any other bonuses (other than being able to be used as a weapon for a Shield Bash).

* **Small Shield** +2
* **Large Shield** +6 [Two-Handed]

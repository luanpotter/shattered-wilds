# Classes

There are a total of 30 classes available in Shattered Wilds, but this large number is just all combinations of a few different archetypes, so it is easier to break it down by type than providing a complete list upfront.

Each class provides a number of Feats that become available on each level. When you level up, you can pick any two feats from your class or Generic Feats (available to all classes) from your level or any previous level. There is no multi-classing rules, as the classes already represented broken-down combinations of different archetypes. Each class maps directly to one of the 9 attribute, and at level 1, you will automatically get a +1 bonus to that attribute as one of the Class Feat Bonus (shared by all classes) plus a unique feat to that class. Starting at level 2, you can start to make choices amongst the available feats (including the Generic Feats). TODO: revisit this 2-feat-per-level system

The first major decision is whether you will be a **Warrior**, a **Caster**, or a **Mystic**. These basically map to the primary Realm that is embodied by the character (Body, Mind, and Soul, respectively).

**Warriors** are the equivalent of the martials in D&D, and their primary attribute will be either STR, DEX or CON. They are experts in physical attacks with weapons, and their special feats focus on powerful maneuvers and tactics in combat.

**Casters** are the equivalent of the arcane spellcasters in D&D, and they have used their Mind to learn the details of the Arcane (see below). They can still (and should) use weapons, as all characters are expected to be fighters, but their special feats involve leveraging their Arcane knowledge to cast spells and manipulate the world around them. In Shattered Wilds, Arcane is a magic and a science, and its effects are down-to-earth and predictable, yet they can be very powerful. However, casting spells requires a strong [[Mind]] and costs [[Resource_Focus_Point | Focus Points]]. Different classes will differ around how flexible / versatile vs specific their feats are, and what is the nature of their powers (which determines their primary attribute between INT, WIS, and CHA).

Finally, **Mystics** are the equivalent of the divine spellcasters in D&D, and they have used their Soul to connect to the Aether and the powerful gods that inhabit it (the Protean). They have a much more chaotic and less predictable form of magic, of which they are only vessels channeling forces beyond their control and understanding. A rule of thumb would be that a Caster chooses the result of their spell, and then roll to assert success, while a Mystic will roll and have the DM determine the outcome. They have more specific spells with less predictable effects, and can do certain types of magic such as healing or divination that are outside the bounds of the Arcane. Their primary attribute will be DIV, FOW or LCK, depending on what kind of power they are channeling.

## Warriors

There are 9 Warrior classes, which are divided in a 3x3 matrix of Roles and Flavors. Each class will then have one unique feat, plus then set of feats that are shared with the other classes in their Role and Flavor.

| Role / Flavor | Martial | Survivalist | Scoundrel    |
|---------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Melee (STR)   | Fighter | Berserker   | Swashbuckler |
| Ranged (DEX)  | Marksman| Hunter      | Rogue        |
| Tank (CON)    | Guardian| Barbarian   | Scout        |

The Role will define your primary attribute (STR, DEX or CON), while the Flavor will grant you other unique feats.

## Casters

There are a total of 12 Caster classes, which are divided in a 3x4 matrix depending on their Role (primary attribute and source of their powers) and Flavor (exact nature and manifestation of that power).

| Role / Flavor  | Arcanist | Mechanist | Naturalist | Musicist    |
|----------------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Erudite (INT)  | Wizard   | Engineer  | Alchemist  | Storyteller |
| Intuitive (WIS)| Mage     | Artificer | Druid      | Minstrel    |

See [Arcane Spellcasting](arcane.md) for a detailed breakdown of what each Role and Flavor entails.

## Mystics

There are a total of 9 Mystic classes, which are divided in a 3x3 matrix depending on their Role (primary attribute and source of their powers) and Flavor (wether they purely dedicate to their channeling or have some mixed martial characteristics).

| Role / Flavor | Pure     | Mixed     | Martial   |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Disciple (DIV)| Cleric   | Warlock   | Paladin   |
| Adept (FOW)   | Sage     | Monk      | Ranger    |
| Inspired (LCK)| Wanderer | Wayfarer  | Warden    |

## Generic Feats

Generic Feats can be picked by any class, as long as the requirements are met.

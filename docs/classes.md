# Classes

There are a total of `30` classes available in **Shattered Wilds**, but this large number is just a result of the combinatorics of a few different roles and flavors, so it is easier to break it down by categorization than providing a complete list upfront.

Characters will pick a **Class** at Level 1 (the first level for a **Hero**). At that level, they will receive their **Core Class Modifier**, which is a `+1` bonus to their **Primary Attribute**; and their **Core Class Major & Minor Feats**.

Then, starting at Level 2, each class provides a set of **Class Feats** that become available on each level. When you level up, you can pick any one **Major** and one **Minor Feat** from your **Class Feats** or the **Generic Feats** lists (the latter available to all classes), from your level or any previous level. There is no multi-classing rules, as the classes already represented broken-down combinations of different archetypes.

The first major decision in picking your **Class** is whether you will be a **Warrior**, a **Caster**, or a **Mystic**. These basically map to the primary Realm that is embodied by the character ([[Stat_Body | Body]], [[Stat_Mind | Mind]], and [[Stat_Soul | Soul]], respectively).

**Warriors** are the equivalent of the "martials" in D&D, and their primary attribute will be either [[Stat_STR | STR]], [[Stat_DEX | DEX]] or [[Stat_CON | CON]]. They are experts in physical attacks with weapons, and their unique **Feats** focus on powerful maneuvers and tactics in combat.

**Casters** are the equivalent of the arcane spellcasters in D&D, and they heavily used their [[Stat_Mind | Mind]] to learn the details of the [Arcane](/rules/arcane). They can still (and should) use weapons, as all characters are expected to be fighters, but their unique **Feats** involve leveraging their **Arcane** knowledge to cast spells and manipulate the world around them. In **Shattered Wilds**, the **Arcane** is a magic and a science, and its effects are down-to-earth and predictable, yet they can be very powerful. However, casting spells requires a strong [[Stat_Mind | Mind]] and costs [[Resource_Focus_Point | Focus Points]]. Different classes will differ around how flexible / versatile or specific their **Feats** are, and what is the nature of their powers (which determines their primary attribute between [[Stat_INT | INT]], [[Stat_WIS | WIS]], and [[Stat_CHA | CHA]]).

Finally, **Mystics** are the equivalent of the divine spellcasters in D&D, and they have used their [[Stat_Soul | Soul]] to connect to the **Aether** and the powerful gods that inhabit it (the **Protean**). They have a much more chaotic and less predictable form of magic, of which they are only vessels **channeling** forces beyond their control and understanding. A rule of thumb would be that a **Caster** chooses the result of their spell, and then roll to assert success, while a **Mystic** will roll and have the DM determine the outcome. They have more specific spells (but still flexible) with less predictable effects, and can do certain types of magic such as healing, buffs or divination that are outside the bounds of the **Arcane**. Their **Primary Attribute** will be [[Stat_DIV | DIV]], [[Stat_FOW | FOW]] or [[Stat_LCK | LCK]], depending on what kind of power they are channeling.

## Warriors

There are 9 Warrior classes, which are divided in a `3x3` matrix of **Roles** and **Flavors**. Each **Role** will define a **Core Major Feat** while each **Flavor** will define a **Core Minor Feat**. On top of that, they will each define their own track of future **Feats** to be picked from. Starting at Level 2, a character's **Class Feats** list will include all options from both their **Role** or **Flavor** tracks.

| Role / Flavor | Martial | Survivalist | Scoundrel    |
|---------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Melee (STR)   | Fighter | Berserker   | Swashbuckler |
| Ranged (DEX)  | Marksman| Hunter      | Rogue        |
| Tank (CON)    | Guardian| Barbarian   | Scout        |

The **Role** will also define your **Primary Attribute** (STR, DEX or CON) for the **Core Class Modifier**.

### Melee Warriors Feats

Melee Warriors focus on Strength, and thus are favored to use **Heavy Melee** or **Thrown** weapons (see a Weapons breakdown under [Equipment](rules/equipment)).

* **Sweep Attack** (Core Major Feat, Level 1): You can spend 3 [[Resource_Action_Point | AP]] and 1 [[Resource_Focus_Point | FP]] to perform an advanced **Melee Strike** against up to three adjacent enemies within your reach. You roll once for all targets, but they Resist separately.
* **Spin Attack** (Level 3+): TODO

### Ranged Warriors Feats

Ranged Warriors focus on Dexterity, and thus are favored to use **Light Melee** or **Ranged** weapons (or both).

* **Take Aim** (Core Major Feat, Level 1): Spend 1 [[Resource_Focus_Point | FP]] and 1 [[Resource_Action_Point | AP]] to target a specific enemy within range of your Ranged Weapon and that you can see clearly; if your next action is a **Ranged Attack** against that target, you get a +3 [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to the [[Stat_DEX | DEX]] Check.
* **Rapid Fire** (Level 3+): TODO
* **Double Shot** (Level 3+): TODO
* **Pinning Shot** (Level 3+): TODO

### Tank Warriors Feats

Tank Warriors focus on Constitution, and thus are focused on defense and therefore do not have a specific weapon focus.

* **Improved Taunt** (Core Major Feat, Level 1): You can spend an additional 1 [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]] as you perform a [[Action_Taunt | Taunt]] action to get a +6 [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to your [[Stat_Intimidation | Intimidation]] Check.
* **Shield Bash++** (Level 3+): TODO
* better armor - less penalty.
* advantage on resist against stumble through

### Martial Warriors Feats

* **Exert Authority** (Level 2): TODO
* **Distributed Shifts** (Level 2): TODO
* **Weapon Mastery (?)** (Level 2): TODO

### Survivalist Warriors Feats

* **Rage** (Core Minor Feat, Level 2): TODO

### Scoundrel Warriors Feats

* **Thieves's Fingers (Minor Feat)** (Level 2): lock picking, trap disarming, etc.
* auto disengage (swashbuckler)
* **Leverage** (Level 2): TODO(sneak attack equivalent)
* **Skilled** (Level 2): TODO

## Casters

There are a total of 12 Caster classes, which are divided in a 3x4 matrix depending on their Role (primary attribute and source of their powers) and Flavor (exact nature and manifestation of that power).

| Role / Flavor  | Arcanist | Mechanist | Naturalist | Musicist    |
|----------------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Erudite (INT)  | Wizard   | Engineer  | Alchemist  | Storyteller |
| Intuitive (WIS)| Mage     | Artificer | Druid      | Minstrel    |
| Innate (CHA)   | Sorcerer | Machinist | Shaman     | Bard        |

See [Arcane Spellcasting](arcane.md) for a detailed breakdown of what each Role and Flavor entails.

## Mystics

There are a total of 9 Mystic classes, which are divided in a 3x3 matrix depending on their Role (primary attribute and source of their powers) and Flavor (wether they purely dedicate to their channeling or have some mixed martial characteristics).

| Role / Flavor | Pure     | Mixed     | Martial   |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Adept (DIV)   | Cleric   | Warlock   | Paladin   |
| Disciple (FOW)| Sage     | Monk      | Ranger    |
| Inspired (LCK)| Wanderer | Wayfarer  | Warden    |

## Generic Feats

Generic Feats can be picked by any class, as long as the requirements are met.

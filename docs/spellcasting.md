# Spellcasting

The Arcane is a science about the laws of physics, the art of controlling the world by recreating shockwaves in reality by precise hand movements and sounds in order to produce certain effects based on the current state of the world. It requires a strong level of focus and mental ability to concoct the exact movements for any desired outcome given any current circumstances.

While creating the necessary movements and sounds can be assisted through the use of mechanical devices, it appears that their primordial source must be tied to a Soul, so it is not possible to completely automate the process. Some sequences of movements can be combined by crafting mechanical devices (the specialty of the Mechanistic caster), but those must still be performed by the caster. Also since the exact movements depend on the circumstances, it cannot be fully prepared ahead of time, requiring intense focus during the moment of casting.

Arcane spells are first and foremost a specific combination of a verb and a noun, which together define their School.

| Verb / Noun | Matter        | Energy      | Being           |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Create      | Conjuration   | Evocation   | -               |
| Transform   | Transmutation | -           | Transfiguration |
| Control     | -             | Telekinesis | Command         |

Casting a spell typically will require a certain amount of AP (Action Points) and FP (Focus Points) to be spent (see Basic Arcane Spell below), requires performing some non-zero amount of Spell Components, and will require a Check on the Spellcaster's Base Attribute, with the following circumstantial modifiers:

> Component Modifiers + Augmentation Modifiers + Characteristic Modifiers + [Other Circumstantial Modifiers]

## Components

The components are the mechanisms used to produce the necessary conditions for the spell to work; they can be in the form of Verbal (sounds), Somatic (movements, typically hand gestures, but can also tool-assisted) or Focal (the simple presence of a specific magical object as a focus). Every spell needs at least one component to be cast, regardless of any other conditions.

Different Flavors of Casters have different access to different types of components; the Arcanists being the more versatile, being able to use all three, but to a lesser potential than the specialists.

| Components | Arcanist | Mechanistic | Naturalist | Musicist |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Verbal     | Y        |             |            | YY       |
| Somatic    | Y        | YY          |            |          |
| Focal      | Y        |             | YY         |          |

It is important to note that the difficulty in performing spell components is due to figuring out what exact movements and sounds are needed to produce the desired effect, rather than the technical difficulty of performing the acts themselves. Therefore you do not need high DEX to perform Somatic components, or high CHA for Verbal components; however if your hands are restricted or you are unable to speak, you will not be able to include those components while casting.

## Verbal

The verbal component can include shouting, chanting, singing, or music produced by the caster via their body or instruments. Typically, this will be done in the form of incomprehensible shouting and chanting of specific sounds, not matching any specific language. Musicists are able to use instruments (accompanied by singing) to replace their Verbal component.

**Basic Chanting**: +1
**One-Handed Instrument**: +2
**Two-Handed Instrument**: +3

## Somatic

The somatic component can include hand gestures, body movements, or tool-assisted movements. Typically, this will be done in the form of fast and precise hand gestures. Mechanistics are able to concoct and use tools to replace their Somatic component.

**Basic Hand Gestures**: +1
**One-Handed Tool Use**: +2
**Two-Handed Tool Use**: +3

## Focal

The focal component can include the simple presence of a specific magical object as a focus. Naturalists are able to create and bind themselves to custom foci by crafting them from materials.

**One-Handed Wand**: +1
**Two-Handed Staff**: +2
**Custom Focus**: +3

## Augmentations

Every spell is a specialization of the Basic Arcane Spell, with a specific Verb / Noun 

Scrolls can be crafted by really powerful Arcanists that are able capture the essence of the immutable parts of instructions for a very specific effect. They can be used by any Arcane Spellcasters, but using them still requires figuring out the rest of the movements given the current state of the world. Heroes might often find specific scrolls written in the past during their adventures. Casting a Spell using a Scroll will provide a bonus to the Check, but the Scrolls are tied to very specific outcomes, and not customizable.

## Characteristics


## Counters

interesting ideas:

* for somatic components, being close-by is the best: grapple, have the longer range spells
* for verbal component, you need to be nearby to shout and mess up the sound waves, distracting this way affects you as well
 ** add an action for this "Verbal Distraction" (takes you Off-Guard)
* for focal component cannot be easily interrupted but only has shorter range spells

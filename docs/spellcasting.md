# Spellcasting

The Arcane is a science about the laws of physics, the art of controlling the world by recreating shockwaves in reality by precise hand movements and sounds in order to produce certain effects. It requires a strong level of focus and mental ability to concoct the exact movements.

While creating the necessary movements and sounds can be assisted through the use of mechanical devices, it appears that their primordial source must be tied to a Soul, so it is not possible to completely automate the process.

Arcane spells are first and foremost a specific combination of a verb and a noun:

| Verb / Noun | Matter | Energy | Being |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Create | Conjuration | Evocation | - |
| Transform | Transmutation | - | Transfiguration |
| Control | - | Telekinesis | Command |

The components are the mechanisms used to produce the necessary conditions for the spell to work; they can be in the form of Verbal (sounds), Somatic (movements, typically hand gestures or tool-assisted) or Material (the simple presence of a specific magical object as a focus).

Different Flavors of Casters have different access to different types of components; the Arcanists being the more versatile, being able to use all three, but to a lesser potential than the specialized flavors.

| Components | Arcanist | Mechanistic | Naturalist | Musicist |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Verbal     | Y        |             |            | YY       |
| Somatic    | Y        | YY          |            |          |
| Material   | Y        |             | YY         |          |

Alongside Stats (and modifiers), a character also has a collection of Feats, which can represent a wide variety of things. Typically a Player character will gain 2 Feats per level, a Skill Feat and an Action Feat.

Skill Feats will typically give [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to a certain Checks under certain circumstances; though they can also grant other benefits. But they are more numerical in nature.

Action Feats typically allow you to perform a unique action, be it an actual [[Action]] during an Encounter, or just the ability of doing something (such as _Dark Vision_). These are more qualitative in nature - though the lines can be blurry.

The reason they are separated is to allow Players to choose a Skill Feat every level. For example, in D&D 5e, if you pick the Chef feat you are probably "underpowered". Since Players must always pick one of each type of Feat, this enables Players to pick Skill Feats without being tempted into over-optimizing for combat damage.

There are three sources of Feats:

* At Level 0, you receive your **Race and Upbringing-related Feats** (and modifiers). (note: Level 0 characters are peasants and not adventurers)
* At Level 1, you pick your Class, and thus receive your mandatory **Class Skill & Action Feats**. The Skill Feat will always be a +1 to your Primary Attribute, and the Action Feat will be the quintessential ability of your class.
* At Level 2 upwards, you can pick any one Skill and Action Feat from your **Class Feats** or the **General Feats**.

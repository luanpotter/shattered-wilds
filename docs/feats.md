Alongside Stats, a character also has a set of **Feats**, which can represent a wide variety of abilities, modifiers and actions. Typically, a Player character will gain 2 Feats per level, a **Minor Feat** and an **Major Feat**.

**Minor Feats** will typically give [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to a certain Checks under certain circumstances; though they can also grant more qualitative minor benefits.

**Major Feats** typically allow you to perform a unique action, be it an actual [[Action]] during an Encounter, or just the ability of doing something (such as _Dark Vision_). These are more qualitative in nature - though the lines can be blurry.

The reason they are separated is to allow Players to choose a **Minor Feat** every level. For example, in D&D 5e, if you pick the Chef feat you are probably "underpowered". Since Players must always pick one of each type of Feat, this enables Players to pick **Minor Feats** without being tempted into over-optimizing for combat damage, and still get their one **Major Feat** every level as well.

At Levels 0 and 1, these **Feats** will be **Core Feats** predefined by their choice of **Race/Upbringing** (at Level 0) and **Class** (at Level 1). These **Core Feats** are uniquely powerful and/or distinct, and are not available to be picked at later levels. Also note that Level 0 characters are peasants and not **Heroes**, which start adventuring at Level 1.

The three sources of **Feats** as you level up:

* At **Level 0**, you receive your **Major and Minor Core Feats** and **Core Upbringing Modifier** from your choice of **Upbringing**; and also your **Core Racial Modifiers** and **Size Category** from your **Race**.
* At **Level 1**, you pick your **Class**, and receive your **Core Class Major & Minor Feats**.  You will also receive the **Core Class Modifier** which is a `+1` bonus to your class's **Primary Attribute**.
* At **Level 2** upwards, you can pick any one **Major** and one **Minor Feats** from your **Class Feats** or the **General Feats** lists.

## General Minor Feats

* **Trade Specialization** (General Minor Feat, Level 2): You are acquainted with a specific trade, allowing you to perform basic tasks associated with it, such as a Blacksmith, Bookbinder, Carpenter, Cartographer, Chandler, Clothier, Cook, Farmer, Fisher, Fletcher, Herbalist, Jeweler, Locksmith, Mason, Miner, Potter, Tanner, Weaver, Weaver, Woodcutter, etc. You can pick this Feat multiple times for different trades.

* **Lip Reading** (General Minor Feat, Level 2): You can read lips to understand what people are saying when you can see them clearly.

* **Animal Mimicry** (General Minor Feat, Level 2): You have an uncanny knack for mimicking animal sounds. If you are familiar with it, and a humanoid could conceivably reproduce it, you can make a good-enough impression that an untrained ear could not distinguish it. An expert (such as someone with the Sylvan Upbringing) could run an [[Stat_Intuition | Intuition]] Check (or [[Stat_Knowledge | Knowledge]] if they have reason to suspect) to try to assess the veracity of the sound.

## General Major Feats

* **Quick Draw** (General Major Feat, Level 2): If you have at least one hand free, you can spend 1 [[Resource_Focus_Point | FP]] to draw a Light Melee Weapon without spending an action.

* **Blind Sense** (General Major Feat, Level 2) [Concentrate]: Your strong connection to your Soul Realm allows you to expand your sense of hearing and smell. You can spend 1 [[Resource_Action_Point | AP]] and 2 [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]] to know the positions of any creature you are aware of within `6m` as well as if you could see them clearly. If they are explicitly trying to sneak, you get a +6 in your [[Stat_Perception | Perception]] Check.

* **Mounted Combat Specialization** (General Major Feat, Level 2) - TODO

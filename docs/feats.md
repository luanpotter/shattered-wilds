Alongside Stats (and modifiers), a character also has a collection of Feats, which can represent a wide variety of things. Typically a Player character will gain 2 Feats per level, a Skill Feat and an Action Feat.

Skill Feats will typically give [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to a certain Checks under certain circumstances; though they can also grant other benefits. But they are more numerical in nature.

Action Feats typically allow you to perform a unique action, be it an actual [[Action]] during an Encounter, or just the ability of doing something (such as _Dark Vision_). These are more qualitative in nature - though the lines can be blurry.

The reason they are separated is to allow Players to choose a Skill Feat every level. For example, in D&D 5e, if you pick the Chef feat you are probably "underpowered". Since Players must always pick one of each type of Feat, this enables Players to pick Skill Feats without being tempted into over-optimizing for combat damage.

There are three sources of Feats:

* At Level 0, you receive your **Race and Upbringing-related Feats** (and modifiers). (note: Level 0 characters are peasants and not adventurers)
* At Level 1, you pick your Class, and thus receive your mandatory **Class Skill & Action Feats**. The Skill Feat will always be a +1 to your Primary Attribute, and the Action Feat will be the quintessential ability of your class.
* At Level 2 upwards, you can pick any one Skill and Action Feat from your **Class Feats** or the **General Feats**.

## General Skill Feats

* **Skill Proficiency**: Choose one skill to get +2 to and another from the same Realm to get -2 to. This can bypass your level cap.

* **Trade Specialization**: You are acquainted with a specific trade, allowing you to perform basic tasks associated with it, such as a Blacksmith, Bookbinder, Carpenter, Cartographer, Chandler, Clothier, Cook, Farmer, Fisher, Fletcher, Herbalist, Jeweler, Locksmith, Mason, Miner, Potter, Tanner, Weaver, Weaver, Woodcutter, etc. You can pick this Feat multiple times for different trades.

* **Lip Reading**: You can read lips to understand what people are saying when you can see them clearly.

* **Animal Mimicry**: You have an uncanny knack for mimicking animal sounds. If you are familiar with it, and a humanoid could conceivably reproduce it, you can make a good-enough impression that an untrained ear could not distinguish it. An expert (such as someone with the Sylvan Upbringing) could run an [[Intuition]] Check (or [[Knowledge]] if they have reason to suspect) to try to assess the veracity of the sound.

## General Action Feats

* **Quick Draw**: If you have at least one hand free, you can spend 1 [[Focus Point | FP]] to draw a Light Melee Weapon without spending an action.

* **Blind Sense** [Concentrate]: Your strong connection to your Soul Realm allows you to expand your sense of hearing and smell. You can spend 1 [[Resource_Action_Point | AP]] and 2 [[Resource_Spirit_Point | SP]] to know the positions of any [[Creature]] you are aware of within 6m as well as if you could see them clearly. If they are explicitly trying to sneak, you get a +6 in your [[Perception]] Check.

* **Mounted Combat Specialization** - TODO

# hexagons

Hexagons is a simple Foundry VTT addon that provides enhanced drawing capabilities for hex grids (either for Hex Crawls or hex-based battle maps such as the ones used in the d12 system).

All tools will snap features to the hex grid of the current map, making it very easy to add features, terrain and annotations to your hex maps.

Note: the toolbar will only appear when a hex grid is detected on the current scene.

## Tools

- **Select Tool**: Select and manipulate existing drawings on the hex grid, allowing movement snapped to the lattice.

- **Line Tool**: Draw straight lines that snap to the hex grid edges.

- **Paint Tool**: Fill individual hexes on the map (including a thin border).

- **Stamp Tool**: Place icons (emoji-based) centered within hexes. Right click to choose a new stamp, left click to repeat previous stamp.

- **Configuration Modal**: Easy access to change the colors used by each tool. Simpler than the default Foundry drawing configuration.

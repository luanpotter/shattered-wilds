conditions:
  blessed:
    name: Blessed
    ranked: true
    description: |
      The creature feels blessed and inspired, to an extent that can actually affects their actions, for a given amount of turns (the **Blessed** _rank_). While **Blessed**, a character can use their [[Luck Die]] for free. At the end of their turn, decrease the **Blessed** _rank_ by 1.

      A character cannot become **Frightened** if they are **Blessed**.
  blinded:
    name: Blinded
    ranked: false
    description: |
      The creature's ability to see is temporarily hampered. They are still vaguely aware of their surroundings if they have other senses (such as hearing and smell), specially their immediate surroundings; however, they might not be able to notice or react to specific, heavily sight-reliant events without an [[Awareness]] or [[Perception]] Checks (to the DM's discretion).

      Other than that, they can still attempt to perform any [[Action]], but have a `-6` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to all [[Action | Actions]] or Checks that require sight (including _Attack Actions_, and the aforementioned [[Awareness]] / [[Perception]] checks), and a `-3` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to all [[Body]] Defense Checks.
  distracted:
    name: Distracted
    ranked: false
    description: |
      The creature is in mental turmoil and unable to use [[Concentrate]] actions.

      This can be caused by the [[Feint]] action and cleared using the [[Focus]] action.
  distraught:
    name: Distraught
    ranked: false
    description: |
      The creature is in emotional and spiritual turmoil and unable to use [[Channel]] actions.

      This can be inflicted by the [[Demoralize]] action, and cleared using the [[Calm]] action.

      It can also be inflicted by the a [[Transfiguration]] **Arcane Spell** such as [[Hideous Visage]].
  frightened:
    name: Frightened
    ranked: true
    description: |
      The creature is terrified by a specific source for a given amount of turns (the **Frightened** _rank_).

      While **Frightened**, a character:

      - Suffers a `-3` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to any Active [[Check | Checks]].
      - Cannot willingly move closer to the source of their fear (i.e. distance between the Hexes cannot decrease due to movement).

      The condition is considered **Intensified** if the creature can see the source of fear _or_ if they have reason to believe that the source of fear can see them.

      The creature can use a **Dispel** action to attempt to dispel the fear by using 1 [[Action_Points | AP]] and 1 [[Focus_Points | FP]] to roll a (Passive) Contested [[Discipline]] Check against the original DC + the current **Frightened** _rank_. If the Fear is not **Intensified**, they get a `+3` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to the Check.

      If the Fear is not **Intensified** at the end of the turn, decrease the **Frightened** _rank_ by 1.

      A character cannot become **Blessed** if they are **Frightened**. If they were to become **Blessed** while **Frightened**, they can instead roll a free **Dispel** action (same rules as above), but they do not become Blessed even if they succeed.
  immobilized:
    name: Immobilized
    ranked: false
    description: |
      The creature is physically restrained, typically through [[Grapple | grappling]], and thus has limited freedom of movement.

      While **Immobilized**, a character:

      - Cannot take Movement [[Action | Actions]] (except [[Escape]], or [[Drag Grappler]] if they are grappled).
      - Can still take **Attack** [[Action | Actions]] with a `-3` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]].
      - Cannot perform **Somatic Spell Components** as they require a greater baseline freedom of movement.
      - **Do not** take any penalties to **Body Defense Checks**, but **cannot** take the [[Dodge]] or [[Take Cover]] reactions.
  incapacitated:
    name: Incapacitated
    ranked: false
    description: |
      The creature is severely incapacitated when their [[Vitality_Points | VP]], [[Focus_Points | FP]] or [[Spirit_Points | SP]] reaches `0`.

      When Incapacitated, a character is:

      - [[Prone]], [[Immobilized]], and [[Unconscious]].
      - Unable to take [[Action | Actions]] (except [[Heroic_Relentlessness | Heroic Relentlessness]]).
      - Helpless and vulnerable to further harm.

      When a character recovers from Incapacitated (by any means), they gain one _rank_ of [[Exhaustion]]. This represents the physical and mental toll of being pushed to the brink of consciousness.

      Incapacitated characters are vulnerable to taking further Consequences.
  off-guard:
    name: Off Guard
    ranked: false
    description: |
      The creature has reduced defensive awareness and readiness. While **Off-Guard**, a character suffers a `-3` [[Circumstance Modifier | CM]] to [[Body]] Defense checks.

      Off-Guard can be caused by the [[Stun]] action and cleared by the [[Catch_Breath | Catch Breath]] action.
  prone:
    name: Prone
    ranked: false
    description: |
      The creature is knocked to the ground or lying down.

      While Prone, a character cannot take Movement [[Action | Actions]] (except [[Get_Up | Get Up]] and [[Escape]]).
  silenced:
    name: Silenced
    ranked: false
    description: |
      The creature is unable to speak, utter sounds, or execute **Verbal Spell Components**.

      While Silenced, a character:

      - Cannot speak or communicate verbally
      - Cannot perform any [[Action | Actions]] that require speech
  unconscious:
    name: Unconscious
    ranked: false

      Depending on the cause of the unconsciousness, the character can be waken up by different means, and might have fallen [[Prone]].

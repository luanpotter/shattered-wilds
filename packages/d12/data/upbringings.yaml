upbringings:
  urban:
    name: Urban
    description: >
      This character lived their childhood in a medium-sized village or town (much larger cities are extremely rare and hard to find). **Human** and **Elven** communities are often **Urban**.
  nomadic:
    name: Nomadic
    description: >
      This character grew up as a nomad, traveling in a small party, family or group venturing through the Wilds (either you'd need to have had strong members to protect you, or somehow have a reason you managed to survive on your own). They are somewhat familiar with the ways of the Wilds. **Human** (often by choice to fulfill their dreams of exploration), **Orc** and **Goblin** (often neglected by their peers or other races) are often **Nomadic**.
      A typical scenario is a small group of low-level adventurers, that eventually have (or encounter) a child, and now must find a way to raise them until they can find the next safe village to drop them off (which can be rare to find depending on where they are).
  tribal:
    name: Tribal
    description: >
      This character grew up in a settlement with a strong tribal structure, with hierarchies and clans. **Dwarven**, **Fey** and **Goliath** communities are often **Tribal**.
  sylvan:
    name: Sylvan
    description: >
      This character grew up in very small settlement embedded deep within the woods. **Elven**, **Fey**, and **Goblin** communities are often **Sylvan**.
  telluric:
    name: Telluric
    description: >
      This character grew up in a cave-dwelling settlement, deep within cave systems. **Dwarven**, **Orc** and **Goliath** communities are often **Telluric**.
